They don’t know how to process vehicles, which are not from the region.\r\nEntering Bahrain: they didn’t give us a visa  or entry stamp first time we visited, but they should! Visa on arrival, 14 days for 50 Saudi Rial (app. 12.00 Euro).\r\n(Multiple entry visa is also available, but I don’t know the cost).\r\nCustoms was a problem: They wanted to have a deposit for temporary import, I show them our Carnet. They have no idea what to do with it! It took us two hours to pass customs. Maybe only the wrong customs officer, all cars from the region just pass through. \r\nInsurance is mandatory for Bahrain (as for Saudi), you have to buy it at the border post (last stop). You have to show Saudi insurance as well!\r\nGoing back is not difficult, but again you have to get the stamp on your carnet at Bahrain customs!\r\nSaudi side extremely fast and friendly: fast entry stamp, easy and fast customs control.",

For a 80liter tank that is 280.000rial or $9 (as they use a poor exchange rate). So don't spend all your money in Astara! No stamp for carnet yet! \r\nUPDATE JUNE 2019: for our 80Liter tank we had to pay 2’730’000 rial (approximately 20$). \n\n\r\nSecond office on the left with the huge antenna:\r\nGet your carnet stamped here after you paid your diesel price difference. \r\n\r\nThird building on the right (exit to Azerbaijan border):\r\nCheck of car and give your exit pass here.\r\n\r\nFourth building:\r\nGet your exit stamp in passport and make sure you have a copy of your passport.

I check and he than start to count millions of rials...than i told him NO again and he become offended. We exit border area, stop in city, ask one lady, she write us address and send us to place where we can exchange money..

We stayed 3 nights on the grass in front of the hotel. We got the key from a room to take a shower. Toilets were open all night. Mr Ali is so amazing friendly and hospitable, he charged us nothing because of the renovation. \nFrom the campsite we did 2 days of hiking and one day the Margoon waterfall, really beautiful. The temperature is very good in this time of year, not to hot! \nFirst picture are the Nomad tents, second is our tent. ",

Parking in front of the bar is quieter, but the street has a slope.\r\n\r\nFarshid is really friendly and wants to help travelers. He offers coffee, smoothies, breakfast and a shower to overlanders. You should pay him by telling good stories from your trip. In the bar there is wifi, electric plugs, and places to work on your laptop. Ask him if you need any help with anything. He does not take money for the help. \r\n\r\nI am writing this because he asked me to.

We chose and marked furthest spot with car. \nIranians/Tehranis know this place so avoid it during weekends by all means. It was quiet and peaceful on Wednesday, but by Friday it had turned into what appeared to be more like festival grounds. \n\nWe were stopped in Churet village and were asked to pay. It didn’t seem very official and price was not clear, no English spoken, and eventually they just told us to follow a motorbike. They escorted us 10km from the village to the lake (all unpaved) and led us via a small unmapped downhill track from the road to the lake, all in the dark.. Not for big rigs and not when wet, but locals do it in normal cars. There are more roads on the map, but they’ve all been blocked so the only way is via Churet village. \n\nUpon arrival they immediately started a fire for us. They asked more for their escort+entry, but accepted 100.000 rial and then brought out the shisha/hookah. The next day they walked around the lake to pick up trash.. a rare sight in Iran. ",

    "description": "Rudkhan Castle (Gilaki: رودخان دژ‎; also Rood-khan Castle) is a brick and stone medieval fortress in Iran that was built by the Gilaks to defend against the Arab invaders during the Arab/Islamic invasion of Sassanian Iran. With the fall of the Sassanid Empire, this area became a defensive position against the Arabs in the then-newly established Tabarestan.\r\n\r\nLocated 25 km southwest of Fuman city north of Iran in Gilan province, it is a military complex which had been constructed during the Sasanian era (224-651), and later rebuilt during the Seljuq era by the Nizari Ismailis. The castle is built on two tips of a mount, with an area of 2.6 hectares (6.4 acres). Its architects have benefited from natural mountainous features in the construction of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Rudkhan Castle River originates in the surrounding heights and flows from south to north.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing a mountainous winding route with dense forests, the first thing that one notices about the castle is its big entrance gate.\r\n\r\nRudkhan Castle sits at the two peaks of a mountain at elevations of 715 and 670 metres and contains strong fortifications and battlements at a length of 1,550 metres. The castle's 42 towers still stand intact.( wikipedia )",

After that it takes about one and a half hour to get everthing done: the entry borderpost (bazargan in our case) must agree. The chassis number was checked. everything is processed in the system. and they print the confirmation of this for you. all items were delivered in the bus! total time from start to finish: 2.5 hours.

Depending on your route, the first 40-50km is a gravel plateau \u0026 plain. Barely sandy. We drove 45km/h there. From the plateau you’ll either end up at the huge dunes of Rig-e Yalan or drive down into the Kalut canyon. Either way, the views of the dunes and kaluts are spectaculair. \r\n\r\nWith some GPS coordinates and the trails on Maps.me, you’ll find your way around. There are also dozens of car trails going everywhere inside the desert - just like you see in Mongolia. Even the guides follow these routes. No point on creating a new route. From this waypoint straight towards the dunes is 100km. And towards Snake Canyon is 60km. a roundtrip drom Shahdad is roughly 500km.\r\n\r\nMind you, on some spots - especially around Snake canyon and the dunes - there is very, very soft sand. We only aired down our tires around the dunes and still got stuck. Make sure you know how to get yourself out of the sand and into safety. Two cars is better than one. Bring plenty of water, fuel, food; no one is there to help. No militairy, no checkpoints, no smugglers.\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun! It was our Iran highlight ",

    "description": "Cheating while entering at port of Bandar Abbas (coming from UAE)\r\n\r\nComing from Sharja to Bandar Abbas, we also paid fees which were either completely unnecessary or unjustified; the latter particularly annoyed us.\r\n\r\nWith Siroos, a so-called «fixer» (trafficker), we agreed an amount of USD 50, so that he helps us with the formalities for the entry into the port and the procedure goes fast. It wasn't fast then, the procedure took 3 hours. In addition to this USD 50, he and his colleague Jafar wanted another USD 30 on the grounds that this would be for Shipping Clearance, Shipping Fee and Bill of Loading, which is total nonsense or a fraud against the tourist who is unaware oft he procedure/cost. These fees have already been paid in Sharja (Al Hili ferry compay) together with the tickets. \r\nThe only thing that has to be paid when entering Bandar Abbas is the harbour fees in the amount of Rial 500'000, which is about USD 5. Proof of this were our companions Thomi and Conny from www.mantoco.com; they did the entry without a fixer and paid only Rial 500'000. In the end, they only had half an hour longer than us. \r\n\r\nHands away from the mentioned fixers; unless you make a fixed amount in advance for their services plus port fees of Rial 500'000; but as we stated, this service would not be necessary.\r\nDo not hand over your documents (passport, Carnet de Passage etc.) or pass through all stations together with the fixer.\r\nIf the fixer insists on further fees or puts a receipt in your hand, it is quite safe in Farsi (which you can't read), or faked. \r\nKey point of the whole story is the payment of the harbour fees. (Unfortunately, the staff standing around that you ask for has no idea about the procedure or doesn't want to tell you anything, so you are forced to call in a fixer.) You can see the office where the harbour dues have to be paid on the photo.\r\n\r\nGood luck and patience to complete the procedure without fraud.",

Shared showers, air conditioning, TV and fridge in the room, no wifi, no towels, no sheet (we had our own slipping bags, probably they are available here). Service barely speaks English, but they are really willing to help. We paid 400 000 IRR/night/2 persons in June 2019. \r\n\r\nBefore we arrived here, we went to the Hotel of Government. It was completely empty that day so a guy wanted to con us and demanded 4 000 000 IRR per night for a really average accomodation. When we protested, he proposed 3 000 000 IRR, but it was still too much for us (backpackers) and - first of all - it wasn't worth that price.

In the end we got other things repaired and stayed three nights with the family also during ramadan festivities. They did not allow us to go to a Hotel - so be sure to bring a small gift if you plan on repairing bigger things, as they will invite you and you have no chance to say no :) Ask for Petram, he speeks English and will help you with everything, not only springs.",

    "description": "Bazargan border crossing - Iran side.\r\n\r\nWhen exiting from Iran to Turkey - they will charge you for any fuel that you have in your fuel tank!\r\nGoing price is 7200 Rial per 1 liter. Everyone pays it equally - locals and foreigners. Here’s the process:\r\n\r\nBefore getting exit stamp on your Carnet you need to pay for fuel and get a paper confirmation. They call this process PETROL. \r\nStart from the far right. When approaching the customs terminal, there will be a road barrier on the right. Park there, walk on foot under the barrier and climb into second office on the right. Bring a copy of your CDP with you, they need it here. If you don’t have one - go to the shop with cigarettes, they make it there for 1000Tomans. \r\nIn this petrol office they will ask you how much petrol do you have. Say as little as possible. I said 40L, although I had a full 80L tank. THEY DO NOT CHECK THE CAR TANK. They just take your number. In their system they will check how big petrol tank is in your car. So play smart. I had no dial left so I negotiated down to 30L, and they say they cannot put less than 30L on the invoice. So even coming with empty tank won’t help you - they will still charge you for 30L minimum. You can pay only by a local card. There’s always someone to help you with that, that person seems to be with the customs. They will take $ or € equivalent in cash from you. I paid 34$ (mix of $ and €), I think about 3.5mil. I saw other receipts and it varied between 4.5 - 9 mil rial. So it seems it’s a legit process. \r\nOnce you have the petrol invoice - go the the far left entrance in the terminal. This is Departure. Go as far as you can and show them Carnet and Petrol invoice. Then normal process starts. They’ll check your car, stamp CDP, you go through Passport control, go back to the car and drive through the barrier to the other side. Turkish side everything was quite easy, except 1h extra for full machine X-Ray of our van. Apparently lots of vans smuggle drugs from Iran, so expect lots of police and military stops on Turkey side asking for cigarettes or drugs. \r\n\r\nAll the process on Iran side took 3h, and maybe 2h on Turkish side. \r\n\r\nNo one will speak English to you, forcing you to use the touts. As usual customs folks just get a kickback. Just stand your ground. If in doubt - look for uniform officer and ask for help, they seemed most helpful. \r\n\r\nBe wary of the touts. They swarmed me like flies. They speak good English and promise to help you. They surely will, I don’t know what’s the price. If you wish to avoid the hassle - pay whatever they ask, and they’ll do it for you. But I always avoid the whole scam process and do it myself. ",

A few young people from Teheran decided to start an eco lodge in Maymand and they did/ do a great job! (It’s not the cheapest option- 20 euro pppn, but def worth it)\r\n\r\nThe eco lodge consists of several caves. You sleep in one of the caves, where they created cosy rooms. There is a shared toilet (squad and European style) and a shared hot shower, both very clean and in another cave on a 2 min walk.\r\n\r\nIn a central cave they provide dinner (€5,-) and breakfast (included in the price). Laundry service available as well (€3,-)\r\n\r\nYou can make beautiful hikes - the nature is stunning! But they also organise nice tours where they work closely with the locals. Ie we joined for a sunset tour and had a super nice evening at a shepherds place where we watched the animals, played games and eat with them. Nothing ‘touristic’, you just join them :)\r\n\r\nThe owners will make you feel at home. It’s def recommended to stay for a few nights! We payed €20,- per night per person, incl breakfast.\r\n\r\nNote: we arrived in the dark and there is no ‘lodge’ kind of sign. Ask the locals or otherwise call 912 371 51 20. The central cave is near the road at your left hand side.",

They're very friendly and hospitable and are trying to do their best, to help you.\r\n\r\nWe've been there with our Sprinter 4x4, as it had problems with both front axle shafts. The wheels got loose all the time and therefore our ABS kicked in very often.\r\nWithout main knowledge about car mechanic related stuff, I wouldn't go there, but if you know, how things should be done: tell them and they will do... because they do not know.\r\n\r\nFirst tool is always (!) the hammer, which is, what I did forbid to be used!\r\nWith Vrej by my side, I was able to tell them exactly, how they should or could fix a specific problem, so they did.\r\nThey understand and will follow your instructions.\r\nIf you do not watch them for every single second, they will mess up things and put the parts together in a wrong way, which will cause problems, when you're on the road again.\r\n\r\nLong story short: You can go there, if you know what has to be done and if Vrej is by your sight.\r\nBetter don't go there, if you're dependent on your overlanding vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe prices though have been VERY fair.\r\nFor the work of 2 people and 8 hours, parts (washers, nuts'n bolts), we paid 51€, which is way less, than expected.\r\n\r\nBut: see my images, what happened, when they wanted to wash the car!\r\n\r\nTake care :)",

    "description": "Azarkhavaran historical castle, located in 60km south east Isfahan (Esfahan), Iran.\r\n\r\nAzarkhavaran is a village in the central part of Jargaviyeh city, Isfahan province, Iran. This village has two historical castles that are more than 400 years old. The village is also called A'bkharoon in the local dialect. In ancient times, the village consisted of seven castles (fortresses) which were: Azarkhvaran, Abkhoran, Dehchi, Diyeh Khoran, Kouhak, Dasht Jahan, Dasht-e Aseman. Among them, Azarkhvaran is considered the central fortress. The name Jargaviyeh is derived from Kuh-e Bacheh or Kouchak Kooh, which is located in Azarkhavaran. Azarkhoran means the splendour and glory of fire, or the land of fiery glory. Azarkhorans have always been the centre and capital of Jargaviyeh, except for the last 50 years.",

Coming from the waterfall, cross the bridge and take the first path on the left to the river.  The path has stones but I think that slowly you get there with any vehicle. From the road they see you, but it is a road with little traffic.  We were very quiet here, nobody said anything to us, and the night was very quiet.  There are some fishermen in the area.",

You can have a shower on request and have electricity in the restaurant. The owner is very friendly and kind. Also the place is at around 3000m of altitude, so it is cool to sleep despite the season.

Just finishing a full restoration and the rooms are brand new, spacious,with European toilets and freezing cold AC. They have 24hr CCTV and a spacious parking area, also 24hr front desk and the two brothers running the place are very professional, friendly and helpful. Farhad speaks a very good English. The price for a double room per night is around 6mil rials (18euros) the standard price for Bandar Abbas but you won't stay in such a nice hotel. Located right across the beach and on a clear day you can see Hormuz on the horizon. We had a pleasant stay in July (no chance camping outside, way too hot and humid).",

    "description": "Interesting village and one of the most beautiful and authentic places that we have seen in Iraqi Kurdistan. \r\nOne of the holiest places of Yazidism is Lalish which has a very holy Yazidi temple. \r\nThe most peculiar thing about Lalish : You can’t wear shoes and you need to walk around barefoot. At the entrance of the village, there is a police checkpoint and they tell you to leave your shoes there. Very friendly, they offered us water on our way back. Very nice experience. It's about 1 hour ride from Dohuk, in the hills. There is asfalt till the village but a small part is in a little bit bad condition.",

When we came there in the afternoon, nobody was at the entrance but late in the evening, it seems you have to pay. But nobody told us anything. \r\nThere are also some trees for shadow. Can sometimes catch wifi from the cafe.\r\nThe parking is located just above Duhok Paradise, a big complexe with restaurants, shisha cafes and a small attraction parc. We stayed 1 night during the week and it gets quite busy, music till 1 am. So can imagine it's much crowded during a weekend.\r\nIt's not a peaceful place but if you want to go out, it's the prefect place to see kurdish night life. But people are nice, no troubles at all. Not only for young people but also for families.",

You can change dollars to Egyptian pounds inside the office\r\n- First thing is a thorough security check. I had to get everything off the bike and into an x-ray machine\r\n- If you don't have a visa and some form of guarantee, you can buy one, they'll call a guy to come over with one, you pay 47usd and then you get your stamp + visa\r\n- Customs is next, the guy is really friendly. I paid 300 EGP to get the carnet stamped\r\n- Next are a couple of offices, not 100% sure what all do, but eventually you are hooked up with an Egyptian driver licence (or motorcycle papers, not 100% sure) and two plates. One for on the bike, one for in the luggage (not sure of that one he said I needed it for when I got to sudan?)\r\n- I paid a couple of times, I think around 500 - 600 EGP total\r\n- When you cross into the border, there is tourist police immediatly checking your passport again\r\n- After about 400m you'll get your first military check\r\n- 400m after that you'll have to pay two bits of taxes, 200 EGP for yourself, 400 EGP for the bike\r\nTook around 3 hours all-in-all, people were relatively friendly, though not so friendly as in Israel",

    "description": "I went with Grimaldi lines, got off at Ashdod (me + motorcycle).\r\nThe process went as follows (there is a problem up which I'll explain later)\r\n- Immigration and security gets on board (in our case in the evening and I was able to spend an extra night on the ship) to take your passport for the immigration\r\n- Go to 'Allaloef' (Grimaldi's shipping partner) to pay for a document - Can't remember the exact name (Grimaldi doesn't tell you about this, but you'll have to pay 150 USD). This is not in the port and requires you to go through security. Taxi is around 40 USD round trip they told me, but perhaps you can get a better deal or have someone from the port help you\r\n- Go to customs, get your paperwork drawn up. You won't need a carnet here, you will need your vehicle papers and your passport\r\n- From customs you'll need to go to another office (near immigration) and pay for release of the motorcycle\r\n- Within that same office there is another room where you go with your stamped / paid paperwork, the person there should be able to get the motorcycle\r\n- Security comes to pick you up, does a security check on the bike / luggage and then they help you through the gates\r\n\r\nIn my case, there was a slight problem (which turned out to work in my advantage). As I didn't ride the motorcycle of the ferry, it was technically not inside Israel. As such, the woman at customs couldn't print her paperwork as this was one of the requirements. After much hassling / calling, they fixed the paperwork (but the bike was still on the vessel). Normally, you will hand the bike over to customs instead of it staying on the ship. For me this was a good thing because when I left it was like 8 o'clock and the customs lockup was closed.\r\nThis confused everyone greatly. Especially for the lady who was in charge of getting the bike from storage. I said I needed to fetch some stuff and came back with the bike (to her amazement).\r\n\r\nSome things to note.\r\n- The ladies at immigration were extremely helpful (I naively stumbled into there thinking that's where I needed to be). There was a woman named 'Rachel' (American, in hebrew / phoenetically it was like caileigh but with a G. So Gggaileigh). She was extremely helpful and spend basically her whole day missioning to Allaloef and customs and helped with the paperwork.\r\n- The immigration office is open until late if not 24hrs\r\n- The office where you get the paperwork you need to pay (like the invoice) is open until 17:00\r\n- The office where you need to go to release the motorcycle and get security is open until 18:00\r\n- The Security people are available 24hrs a day\r\n\r\nIt was a gruesome 9 hour day, but I was able to get the bike into the country the same day",

No infrastructure whatsoever. The place is exposed to wind and there is no cover except your own vehicle. As it lies at more than 1300 m a.s.l., it’s cool up here. And very quiet. The gravel track up from Fins is *extremely* steep and winding, however, some of the trickiest bends have been sealed with concrete. Still, a 4WD is a good idea and becomes a necessity in times of rain. Not recommended for big rigs, even if they are 4x4.\r\n",

Keep in mind that aspects of this are technically prohibited by the Omani government, but it is still doable with persistence. \r\n\r\nAsking at offices in town provided no luck. Going to the port led us to one contact, which led to another and then another. After 3 or 4 days of phone calls we met with a merchant who offered us passage on his vessel. \r\n\r\nHe tried to charge us 1000 USD. We knew this was unreasonable as the merchant going to Bosaso had offered us passage for the expense of food (~50 USD). Negotiate as well as you can. The two of us are students so used that card, which may have helped. \r\n\r\nTo finalise the deal we had to organise our Somaliland visas and Salalah Port Passes. One of our contacts helped with both of these. The harder of the two is the Port Pass. To obtain this we had to get our passports listed on the ships manifest and then take this to the Royal Oman Police Headquarters listed on iOverlander. Our friend knew someone at the immigration department, which may have helped get our manifests stamped with port approval.\r\n\r\nNow the fun begins. Our merchant said the boat would leave in 3 days, inshallah. This turned into 12 days (including 3 days of public holiday for Sultan Al Qaboos passing away). \r\n\r\nOur boat has limited hygeine by western standards. We are sleeping on the deck. Our crew is nice albeit they speak limited English.\r\n\r\nRemember to be persistent and that inshallah means inshallah... Good luck!",

There was much debate about whether I needed car insurance -almost let me go then said I needed car insurance. Started the process right there in customs, but I showed them my yellow card comesa insurance and they decided that was ok. Comesa doesn't cover Saudi (at least not what I bought in Zambia). I bought no car insurance.\r\n\r\nI was able to keep my contents locked in my camper all the way from Sawakin till we were with our truck at customs in Jeddah. I had to give my truck key to Saudi customs to get off the ship, they had truck and key for 3 hours and drove it somewhere with a passenger. I had removed all the contents of truck cab at Sawakin and locked them in the camper. My truck was too big for their x-ray, so once we were reunited I unlocked stuff and they did a thorough dog sniff search. They wanted to do more searching but realized it would be a big job and they would find nothing - so they got the bosses boss permission to not do the search, this \"do nothing\" took 2 extra hours.\r\n\r\nSee my entry in Sawakin for ferry information and packing of truck.\r\n\r\nGPS is not the exact location.

We were really exposed (2 chairs, awning, stoves outside, etc) and people came every few minutes to ask us what we're doing here and found it very interesting. While in the daytime it has been very calm, life begins once the fountain starts (with sunset). People coming here for picnics and enjoying the sunset and fountain.\r\nThe place has been very tidy (trashcans all around and people, who are cleaning all the day) and \"old\" shouldn't keep you away from this site. The view onto the  King Fahd's Fountain is really nice.\r\nIf you wanna be alone, this place is definitely not for you. And for all others: you'll enjoy dozens of cultures, as well as some of the most friendliest people in the world!\r\nToilets: not directly at this place, but a few hundred meters along the street.",

It rained and thundered while we camped here, but I am certain that on days with better weather swimming will be a treat on this secluded beach. The campsite and restaurant share toilets which are clean and there is a basic shower available. Electricity is provided via one of the Restaurant cubicles. This seems like a fairly new establishment with great potential and for 30 TL a night, it was quite worth the picturesque location over the vast ocean.\r\nContinuing to function as a picnic area, but the public toilets/showers are being renovated and unusable. However we were allowed the use of a private (clean) toilet/sink. Besides this toilet, I’m not sure what other facilities are available. We weren’t charged for camping in their parking lot.

She will explain you the procedure and give usefull information: \r\n\r\n1. Go through immigration to get your passport stamped.\r\n\r\n2. Customs : there are some guys insisting to help you through the process. But as the tourist lady explained, the border services are totally free so you dont need the help of those guys. If you let them, they will charge you 5-10 EUR or take a heafty commission on money change or car insurance.\r\n\r\nInsist on doing it yourself. You need your carnet de passage, a copy of your passport and copy of Iran visa. When entering the customs hall, you need to go to a small desk to collect some signatures on the back page of the carnet. Then proceed to the customs counter (right). After a few stamps, signatures and the car inspection you can drive down (about 1km) towards the final gate.\r\n\r\n3. Insurance: If you are not covered by your green card, you will have to get an insurance coverage here. The office is just before the exit gate on the left side, called 'Iran Insurance'. Again you dont need anyone help for that, but after they started registering us in their system, someone decided to 'translate' for us and at the end we found out he was a stout 'working' with the insurance guy to get a lot of money from us. They asked 110 EUR for a months but after refusing to pay and insisting on seeing a price list, we paid 30 USD (payable in USD or EUR but they won't have change or in Riel).\r\n\r\n4. Money change : The tourist bureau lady also gave us the official bank day rate to avoid confusion. The exchange rate in the official exchange shop just outside when exiting the border is actually better than the bank rate she gave us. Unless I can't do differently, I usualy avoid changing money with the guys running after you at the border.",

We also got selected to get the car x-rayed which included a 1 hour wait to get a turn. Then they will ask you for your green card insurance on a few stations. \r\nAfter all they didn’t really question too much why we went through north Iraq (never ever call it Kurdistan on the Turkish side). We just said it’s not as cold as the mountain area at  the Iran/Turkey border and that wes good enough. \r\nJerrycans are not allowed but our 20L was half full and the guy said it’s ok.

Most of the dirt tracks around the lake leading to the lake are forbidden for vehicles (only written in Turkish). After we drove almost half around the lake we found this spot next to the lake. There are several dirt tracks leading to this spot. It is completely quiet, nobody around (in peak season on a weekend!!!). You only can hear a bit of the road but there is not a lot of traffic. Take care if you want to drive directly on the beach, it is really bad ground (sand and loam). We got stuck and had to dig for at least 4 hours. No shade and 4x4 recommended! 3G to 4G signal with turkcell.",

Tickets can be bought at a small office along the street but getting a ticket in advance might be useful when traveling by car or motorcycle since it's a very small boat with limited space. Customs was very easy and quick. Price €52,- and the crossing takes about 45 minutes. From Chios you can get an overnight ferry to Piraeus (Athens).",

Some of the spots are inaccessible with a big rig but you can defiantly find a spot here with a truck as well :)\r\n\r\nWe were not able to camp by the canon mentioned at the other wildcamp due to wind. This place however works just fine if you stay in a roof top tent. \r\n\r\nWe had police come when we were setting up camp, they said that they just passed by and we’re wondering what we were doing. Super nice and after we explained that we just stayed for sleeping they left us with good nights wishes. ",

Very thorough mechanic—he also checked bearings, brakes and replaced hub seals. Since he builds off road trucks and  also makes custom after market accessories like bullbars (saw him bending 3 1/2 mm thick tubing!), we had him install custom fender flares/mudflap extenders and also weld up a battery box for the in-cabin Li battery. Also saw him clean the considerable crap out of the diesel tank of an overlander  LC78. Our Istanbul contact showed us the nice custom drawer system Servet installed in their new Jeep. Like other mechanic work I’ve had done in Turkey, Servet’s prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\n(Due to coronavirus lockdown, we worked with Servet from December to June!!)",

According to tradition, Shem'un had a dream in which an Angel commanded him to build a House of Prayer in a location marked with three large stone blocks. When Shem'un awoke, he took his teacher to the place and found the stone the angel had placed. At this spot Mor Gabriel Monastery built.\r\n\r\nDayro d-Mor Gabriel is a working community set amongst gardens and orchards, and somewhat disfigured by 1960s residential accommodation. The monastery's primary purpose is to keep Syriac Orthodox Christianity (incl. the original language Aramaic) alive in the land of its birth by providing schooling, ordination of native-born monks.",

In the mornings you wake up to the water rushing, untill noon you are sheltered from the sun by the mountain shadow. We left our tent and bikes during the day, felt very safe. On the beach there is cold water showers. \r\n\r\nHow to get there: When facing the beach, go all the way left over the boardwalk and than further over the sand, around the rocky wall that seems to be the far left end of the beach. When you walk around the tip of it over the beach, you enter the area that is dedicated for camping (officially allowed).\r\n\r\nPs. Go paragliding and scuba diving, you won't regret it!",

Ani was a former Armenian capital many centuries ago and its buildings now have World Heritage status.  Remote location, few trees, very poor villages caring for goats cows but stunning spot with views across to Armenian snow capped mountain ranges.  The large flat car park has stunning views.  We asked at ticket office if we could overnight and it was agreed.  We will visit the site in the morning before driving on to Georgia.  There are toilets outside the site near the car park which are open at least up to 7pm and open at 8am.  I went to look at 7.30pm when everyone had left and they appear to be unlocked.  They are new but poorly cared for.  There is a cafe which is not open out of hours. You need to check when site is open as may be snowbound in winter and may not be open. The space is flat, cobbled and suitable for big rigs.  Easy to turn around.   Has a CCTV camera which makes it more secure and some lighting in car park.  There is a water fountain a few kilometres before you reach the car park listed separately.  You would need to fill water containers from taps. ",

Application for the ikamet needs to be done before expiry of the tourist visa. After application it may still take many weeks before you receive the ikamet card, even though your visa expired, but that’s no problem as long as you have the proof of application. Nevertheless, (this) customs office wants to see your ikamet card AND extension of the car permit needs to be done BEFORE expiry. This means you need to apply for your ikamet well before expiry of your tourist visa so you receive it in time or these guys will fine you for extending your car permit too late. \r\n",

One of the employes speaks English and we were forwarded to her when our number was displayed.  \r\n\r\nIn Turkey there is no possibility to pay toll at the gates of the highway. All the gates read you number plate automatically and if you don’t have an barcode “HGS Stripe” with enough deposit on it for the last stretch you drove, than it recognizes your car in a database. You have 14 days to balance it. When you don’t balance, it within it makes a fine on your account. When you want to leave the country with your car, and your HGS is not balanced, you have to pay a fine. Even higher when you don’t have an HGS.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to pay online. It is possible only for Turks. You have to go to an PTT Office (Post) to pay. There you have the next problem as a traveler: PTT is open only from Monday to Thursday. If you need it on Friday to Sunday…. You find some rare ones closed to highways. This have other opening hours. So this is why this PTT is very useful. It is directly on an highway junction, so you can reach it easily and it is open longer. ",

They asked for a plane ticket, we didnt have one and they didnt bother.\n\nMind you: this is the new address of the embassy, they moved in April ‘19. The addresses on Google are not correct :).\n\nUpdate: when we arrived in Djibouti, you could get a visum on arrival at the airport, but it’s much slower and more expensive. Your choice!",

You can do it easily by yourself as most of the customs‘ staff speaks English and also knows what you have to do next. After each step you get told what to do next and where to go.
