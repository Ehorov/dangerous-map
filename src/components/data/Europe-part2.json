The best campspot is at Curmatura Oltelului viewpoint at 1650 metres, 360° roundview over the mountains. You can also hike from up there, or drive to the 67c. At the track from Polovragi to the viewpoint are several campspots alongside the river. From the lake you can drive to Ciungetu and on to the 7A and subsequently on to the 67C to do the best part of the Transalpina. Nice drive all around!",

There is 1 levelled spot where the grass was flattened, probably used by some locals for river access. No one was around though. Further down the track is a large meadow, but in sight of houses and closer to the highway \r\nwith higher grass. Place can be reached by leaving the highway at 46.2266003, 24.7679573, right off the highway if coming from Sighisoara. Take a left to cross under the highway and follow the track along the fields and the river. Best to use Google sattelite. As the track is narrow and deep at some places, good clearance is needed. Grass was flat when we were there, but could be not ideal for camping when not flattened. ",

The road is a mostly gravelroad or sandroad, bumpy here and there and maybe a bit more diffcult to drive, when it's muddy, but also standard cars are driving here.\r\nThere are other people around, also some farmers, but everybody is friendly and you also can make a campfire.\r\n\r\nThe view is phenomenal and we stood here for 2 days.",

Take care about lots of mud and some areas are swampy, but also standard cars are driving here.\r\nWe stood here for 2 days. It's very calm, but other Romanians might camp here and make a campfire.\r\nThis area is also appropriate for a bigger rig and the views are very nice.\r\nThe nice Chiuca Falls are also in the near, if you're driving along the river up north up to the next crossroad. Keep right and there's a small gravelroad, which you might follow. The waterfall entrance is at the end of this road, where there's also a small parking lot.\r\nIf you consider walking to the waterfall, wear appropriate shoes. There are two ways: One up a hill, which is pretty steep and not always easy.\r\nThe other one is along the river, where there's a sidewalk at the rocks. Here your feet will get wet and you'll need to balance along a steel-rope. Not easy, but doable and not appropriate for children!",

The locals all seem to be used to cyclists coming here to cycle along the Danube, so they are all friendly. \r\n\r\nThe grass is easy to pitch and there are sheltered picnic tables and bins. 2G signals only.\r\n\r\nNot sure about carparks but I think you can find something.

Not sure about the summer months). No facilities but no cost. There are also a handful of campgrounds scattered throughout the park. They are well signed. ",

There are 2 ways (what I've seen), one a trekking path the other one an off road, it does not matter which one you take cos both connected at one point.\r\nto get there by the trekking path you have to go  the top of the Calle Padre Paco Ostos and there will be the path. Go up and in the first fork take the left (still going up) then when you get to the top it will be the off road junction turn left and all the lefts you find until you get there.\r\nIt's very flat and with an amazing view of Marbella and the sunset.",

The shower and toilet block was clean and well maintained.  There are also black and grey water disposal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe bar and restaurant is excellent, specialising in local venison (venado) and wild boar (jabalí).  It is also seems well patronised by local residents from Navas de Estena.\r\n\r\nSpring to early summer is probably the best time to see this area, it is hot and dry in Summer (but you will appreciate their excellently maintained swimming pool).  If you find yourself passing through this area or are looking for a stop off in central Spain, this campsite is worth the detour.",

The road is not big rig friendly (5 ton and over). Several hairpin turns and narrow. Ideal for Westphalia and Jumper style and size. I came up from the south. Saw a large plastic Fiat camper. Maybe came up from the north. Entrance will be from the east side of the main road and roughly 2- 2.5 km to park. No official entrance. Keep your eyes open for parking on your left with roughly 22 parking spots separated by wood poles. Private residence beside  parking lot. Please be courteous! Off the parking lot is bike and hiking trails. Picnic area is tiered with lots of picnic tables in good condition. Stone fences in semi circular arches round out this wonderful scene of the Mediterranean. Although there is a sign saying water is available, I found the water taps capped off. No water for some time. \r\n\r\nNo amenities here at all. You should be fully self contained, or prepare to drive into town and back. At the end of the road is a beautiful lighthouse on the edge of the promontory. About 1 km from parking lot. Unknown at this time if operational. WiFi is sketchy. Parking lot is gravel. Please be environmentally friendly and stick to the trails and avoid walking on flora and fauna.\r\n\r\nSo, from here I’ll let the pictures do the talking!\r\n",

The big ginger cat is the softest cat in the world and will jump on your bed for strokes if you let him inside. \r\n\r\nGo to Lidl on the way for ease but he does have a mini shop and a bar anyway. \r\n\r\nWindy road down to campsite looks mental on google maps but it’s really wide and almost new tarmac so there are absolutely no issues getting in or out even with a 6 metre van. We saw some google reviews saying they couldn’t get their van down but those drivers should have their licence taken away because the road is bigger than most UK main roads. \r\n\r\nPaid €17.50 for two with campervan.

    "description": "My issue was as follows: I left the EU on a land border crossing in June 2018 (Bulgaria to Turkey) and entered the EU again on a flight from Colombia to Madrid in October 2019. Even though my motorcycle was bought \u0026 registered in Belgium (EU), customs insisted that any cargo arriving at the terminal needs to be cleared by means of an import declaration - something I didn't expect, since \"it's just a Belgian bike re-entering in the EU\". Also the fact that I didn't have an export declaration seemed to be an issue for them (I didn't ask for that when leaving the Bulgarian border, not even sure if you can get it there).\r\n\r\nI went to some customs agencies, and \"Jesa Cargo Aduanas\" saved my day! Because of uncertainties (which codes to use, how to declare for a non-resident, how to import tax-free without an export document), Jesus went along to the customs office to discuss the matter with the officials directly - he knows everybody there. \r\n\r\nThe issue was quickly resolved:\r\n- use code C08 - 101 for tax free import - the agency will know what this is, and this was confirmed by the customs officials themselves\r\n- get yourself registered in the customs system as a non-resident by means of your passport\r\n\r\nShortly after, Jesus filed the import declaration, and all was resolved. He really went out of his way to help me out, he's very knowledgeable, and just an overall great guy! He charged me 80 euros, what seemed a very reasonable price to me (other agencies quoted up to 325 euros + VAT, for the same job, and I'm sure they didn't really know what to do).\r\n\r\nSo if you're facing the same issue, go see Jesus! And probably also for any customs procedure involving vehicles, it's his specialty he said.",

The area is remote and the village, Zarzosa, is the last one on the road. Probably, you will only come here if you are walking or cycling between Zarzosa and Vadillos (beautiful and steep). Just a little further up, there is a forest church with another picnic area and gravel road access.",

We do not repair mechanical parts of your car, but know some very good and cheap workshops. \r\n\r\nYou can use our adress as a shipping adress for e.g. Amazon. But we can also provide translation assistance or assistance in hospitals / medical centres. We have been the contact for medical emergencies on cruise ships in the region for several years. We know that in such situations it can be very difficult to cope in a country you don't know like your own. \r\nAs we have lived in Spain for 15 years and speak English and French as well as Spanish, we are prepared for many situations. \r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nAvec notre garage entièrement équipé et nos années d'expérience, nous proposons toutes les réparations à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de votre habitat overlander ou camping-car. Remplacer les fenêtres, réparer les pompes à eau, changer les charnières, installer des panneaux solaires ou autre. Comme nous construisons notre propre Overlander, nous sommes également heureux de discuter avec un café. Nous ne réparons pas les pièces mécaniques de votre voiture, mais connaissons quelques ateliers très bons et bon marché. \r\n\r\nVous pouvez utiliser notre adresse comme adresse de livraison pour Amazon, par exemple. Mais nous pouvons également fournir une aide à la traduction ou une assistance dans les hôpitaux / centres médicaux. Depuis plusieurs années, nous sommes le contact pour les urgences médicales sur les bateaux de croisière dans la région. Nous savons que dans de telles situations, il peut être très difficile de se débrouiller dans un pays que vous ne connaissez pas comme le vôtre. \r\nComme nous vivons en Espagne depuis 15 ans et que nous parlons l'anglais et le français ainsi que l'espagnol, nous sommes préparés à de nombreuses situations. \r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nMit unserer voll ausgestatteten Werkstatt und jahrelanger Erfahrung bieten wir alle Reparaturen innerhalb und außerhalb Ihres Overlander- oder Wohnmobil-Lebensraums an. Fenster austauschen, Wasserpumpen reparieren, Scharniere wechseln, Solarpaneele installieren oder was auch immer es sein mag. Da wir unseren eigenen Overlander bauen, sind wir auch gerne bereit, bei einem Kaffee zu plaudern. Wir reparieren keine mechanischen Teile Ihres Autos, kennen aber einige sehr gute und günstige Werkstätten. \r\n\r\nSie können unsere Adresse als Versandadresse für z.B. Amazon verwenden. Wir können aber auch Übersetzungshilfe oder Hilfe in Krankenhäusern / medizinischen Zentren leisten. Wir sind seit mehreren Jahren Ansprechpartner für medizinische Notfälle auf Kreuzfahrtschiffen in der Region. Wir wissen, dass es in solchen Situationen sehr schwierig sein kann, in einem Land zurechtzukommen, das man nicht so gut kennt wie sein eigenes. \r\nDa wir seit 15 Jahren in Spanien leben und sowohl Englisch und Französisch als auch Spanisch sprechen, sind wir auf viele Situationen vorbereitet.",

On the tour there are many steps, and it is important that all visitors are able to walk without assistance all the way. Temperature inside the mine is around +5ºC, bring warm clothes and comfortable shoes.\r\nAll year round the World Heritage House and several historic buildings are open, and the mine walk gives an exciting view over the Great Pit, the town of Falun... \r\nThere are also nice shops, cafés, and a restaurant on the site.\r\n(Source: https://www.falugruva.se/en/)",

You can park a vehicle on the side of the road, but you have to walk a couple of meters to reach this place, therefor it is only suitable for tents. There are no services except for the 2 logs and a fireplace. There is space for up to 3 tents. \r\n\r\nTo reach this spot drive to the parkingspot. (There also is a boatramp. If you stand on the jetty you can see the camping spot. (You'll get an idea how far to drive) drive on the gravel road untill you see a small path on you right, it's not far. We parked our car there and walked to set up camp.",

So after getting the exit stamp of Ukraine go to the Moldovan registration bureau directly (literally 3m) behind the Ukrainian costum service when exiting Ukraine. The procedure is easy: Go to their little cabin (you can´t miss it, it should be at the end of lane 3 or 4) and you´ll get the stamp.\r\n\r\nIf you are entering Transnistria by car you have to pay a tax (4 USD for our VW T4, you can also pay with EUR, UAH ...). So before qeueing in the line for the regular immigration drive to the left after crossing the river and you´ll see a building with two floors. Just go inside on the first floor to counter 1, get a piece of jotting paper on which they write the amount you have to pay, take it to counter 3, pay ... that´s it. Immigration itself is super relaxed, but make sure you have the paper for the tax. Otherwise you have to turn back when you arrive at costums control (so happened to us).\r\n\r\nAll in all an interesting border with nice people and very quick and uncomplicated (no car check at all) ;)",

Ukraine guards didn't trust us because we came from Kazakhstan and they did a very unprofessional but thorough search. They took off our walls to check for drugs and checked EVERYTHING. Took 1.5 hours and a sniffing dog (puppy) even gave a false positive! They accused us of having marijuana which we clearly had not, very unpleasant situation. When we started to phone our embassy they let us go. At 00:00 we left Ukraine. \r\n\r\nEntering Poland took 3.5 hours of pure waiting. Very very slow, you could move 10 meters every 15 minutes. Around 120 cars  total in the queue before us and hundreds of truckers. It was very simple, no search and no documents to fill out. Just hand the documents to the guards and wait.. At 3:30 am we were finished!\r\n\r\nSo: I don't know how busy it us during the day, but when arriving at 9pm it was very very busy. Not a difficult crossing when you don't get searched!",

    "description": "Found this hotel by accident and stayed a whole week exploring the nearby Carpathian Mountains. great location for unloading your motorcycle and taking off on the dirt trails up into the hills for day trips. I even brought minimal camping gear and left the rest of my stuff at the hotel and took off for 2 days for some wild camping on the next Ridgeline over from this mountain range.\r\n\r\nthe owners are super friendly and definitely off-road enthusiast. I met a few new Czech friends who where here at this hotel the 9th time for a week long motorcycle vacation. If you have any problems with your bike the hotel has a covered parking area and plenty of tools they are more than happy to lend you. Should you need any parts they have some friends nearby that can get just about anything you need.\r\n\r\nSingle Room: 15 Euros a night\r\nDinner: 150-250 Ukrainian\r\n\r\na single room having a huge bed with hot shower and bathroom is 15 Euros a night including a pretty hardy breakfast. they have 3 and 4 bed rooms but not sure of the prices of those as I'm just one person. it's also possible to camp at this property as well in the garden next to the creek that runs through the property. I'm sure this is a cheap option but I forgot to ask the price to pitch a tent. if you do camp you might be woken up around 8 in the morning by the grazing goats nearby who have bells around their necks. \r\n\r\na very large and delicious dinner is served in the resorts restaurant every night. it's usually grilled BBQ or fish with potatoes and salad of some kind. if your into veggie meals they do that as well. the dinners cost anywhere from 150-250 grivna per meal.\r\n\r\nthey also have beer for 50 grivna a half liter on tap. juice, coffee, and sodas as well. \r\n\r\nthey have a sauna in the hotel as well as a cold dipping pool filled up by the river. they also have a pressure washer which they will let you use to clean your vehicle off with after you go out playing in the mud.\r\n\r\nno one speaks English here however they do speak Russian Ukrainian and Czech. I would highly recommend to agree on a price before moving in because I was told 15 euros a night but wanted to pay in Ukrainian money as I didn't have Euros so we had to work out the conversation rate. they don't take card sooooooo bring plenty of cash because most places in this area are cash only. I stayed 5 days and wild camped for a night in the near by mountains. this was my total for my time at the hotel:\r\n\r\n3900 grivna total for:\r\n\r\n5 nights single bed room\r\n5 dinners\r\n5 breakfasts\r\n2 soup lunches\r\n6 liters of boxed juice\r\n8 draft beers\r\n1 coffee\r\n\r\nhighly recommend the hotel as well as exploring this area of Ukraine if you're on a motorcycle or 4x4. amazing beautiful.

She is in the process of turning this place into a Sri Chaitanya compound.\r\n\r\nI'm not exaggerating when I say this manor is in the middle of nowhere. It took me 45 minutes to get out here in BFE bombing down dirt roads. She was shocked as I was to see anyone here haha\r\n\r\nShe told me that she rented out her apartment in Lviv where she lived her whole life and move down here to be closer to God and do some more meditation... Also just as luck would have it that a little puppy dog came walking up to this place a few weeks ago who she adopted. He was the coolest!\r\n\r\nThis manor was kind of mysterious and creepy all at one time. There were cows grazing around it and the building itself seemed in decent shape but it is locked up tight as a drum...\r\nYet it also looks like it hasn’t been used in years. \r\n\r\nBuilt in the early 1900’s nobody including Natasha seems to know what happened to it through out the 20th century. Other locals say in the 90’s a business man bought it and started making repairs before there was some controversy about if he was allowed to buy it or not. Finally he walked away and it has remained locked since... Until now!\r\n\r\nNatasha was good enough to send me down the road with a huge piece of apple pie...

    "description": "Coolest experience of my trip here in Europe so far... Aaand quite possibly of my life!!! I got to spend the night in what was an active intercontinental nuclear ballistic missile silo \r\n\r\nThe Tour costs $12 USD!\r\n\r\nI held the A.C.T.U.A.L. key that could have ended the world. If that isn't cool... I don't know what is.\r\n\r\nThis was not your average tour... This wasn't even supposed to happen.... But it did!!!\r\n\r\nAfter a long day on the bike I show up close to dark at what I think is just a Soviet military museum in the middle of no where... Negative...... 30 years ago this was the most strategic and secure point in the entire USSR!!!!!\r\n\r\nWith the input of a secret ever-changing code, a flick of 2 separate switches, and the simultaneous turn of 2 keys less than 10 feet (3m) apart a nuclear warhead could reach the United States in less than 22 minutes \r\n\r\nThis former Soviet base contains 3 missile silos that were just over 140 feet (43m) under ground. Each individual silo was covered by a hatch that weighed 14 tons! This hatch could open fully in just 8 seconds!!! In 1959 the construction of this base started in the early fall.... In the summer of 1960 it was fully operational! In less than one year the Soviets built and engineered this entire base.\r\n\r\nAt the time this base was completed it had state of the art computers which were also underground in a room that was big enough to be used as a warehouse... 85 percent of the cooling capacity of the liquid helium refrigerators was used solely to cool this behemoth of a computer!!! The smart phone you have in your hand right now has 20 times more computing power than this Soviet cutting edge 60's tech.\r\n\r\nThe missile... Let's talk about that little guy.... It had a range of 15,500 miles (25,000km) which was more than enough to reach out and touch the States just about anywhere the Red Army wanted to. It's minimum range was 1,200 miles (2,000km) \u0026 this was important incase they fancied an attack on the UK, France ooooor Western Germany. It carried a warhead 37 times stronger than that was dropped on Hiroshima! The missile herself weighed so much the Soviets had to manufacture a truck capable of carrying so much weight with multiple electric motors in each wheel... There were 24 wheels..... All with their own motor to help the diesel powered truck up the hills and down the highway.\r\n\r\nThey also had a secret train which was used to carry missiles thought the USSR... Very under the radar because there's trans were made to look old and busted... The only way you would know these were not normal passenger cars as they passed you on the tracks were the fact they had 4 wheels instead of 2 at each end of the train cars... Because the weight of the missiles works have crushed a single axle train.\r\n\r\nThe Soviets had to move, install, and seal up the missile in her silo in less than 2 hours or the Americans with our satellites would know what these commies were up to. Which could have very easily caused the cold war to go hot... Damn hot!\r\n\r\nAfter the soldiers who guard this base gave me the nickel tour which lasted 3 times as long as it should have I asked them if it was ok to camp in front of the base... They told me no it was not buuuuuut I was more than welcome to have a bed in their barracks, share some cognac, and have dinner with them.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers work a 3 day shift of 24 hours and rotate out every week. They were great guys and incredible friends! We talked about my time in Iraq \u0026 Afghanistan as well as their time in Afghanistan... It was a different war they were fighting and it was fantastic to see both sides of the coin as well as have the full tour of this amazing place that very easily could have ended humanity as we know it @ Strategic Missile Forces Museum, Ukraine",
