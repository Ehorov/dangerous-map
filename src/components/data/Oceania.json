Be careful when setting up camp, especially if it is windy, as large branches can easily squish you if they land on your tent.\r\n\r\nWell maintained long drop toilets are located near the entrance to picnic/camping area, and a large sheltered area with picnic tables is also provided.\r\n\r\nNumber of sites:\r\n30\r\n\r\nCamping Fees:\r\nThis is a great free campground, please say thanks by leaving the place in good condition and shopping locally.\r\n\r\nThis is a free camping area.\r\n\r\nHow to book:\r\nNo bookings are required. It is reasonably popular in the warmer months, but due to the high altitude (read freezing) is mostly deserted in Winter.\r\n\r\nToilets:\r\nLongdrop or composting\r\n\r\nPets:\r\nNot allowed\r\n\r\nWater Availability:\r\nNon-potable water may be available.

    "description": "Swamp Creek Reserve is a small reserve right alongside the Peel River; the reserve is broken into two by Swamp Creek and is connected by a bridge on the road and a small walking bridge right beside the road. The side the Toilet is on is best recommended for big Rigs as there is a bigger turning circle area; the opposite side is suitable for Caravans and tents.\r\n\r\nBecause of the junction of the Peel River and Swamp Creek the water levels have been seen to rise quickly and the Tamworth Regional Council has advised of flash flooding in the area.\r\n\r\nThe area is well known for gold and gemstone fossicking and plenty of time can be spent in the water way panning for Gold. The local town of Nundle offers plenty of tourist attractions. The Woolen mill is a must for Australian Grown and Made Woolen products from yarn to clothing. The socks are even made right here at Nundle and a tour of the woolen mills is very informative.\r\n\r\nSITE ACCESS\r\nIf leaving from Tamworth travel towards Nundle. The reserve can be accessed from either end of Rivers Road. The road is gravel, if coming from Nundle the distance is 2Km.\r\n\r\nFEES \u0026 BOOKINGS\r\nThere is no charge for the use of this facility at the moment, so if you are staying at this site we encourage you to help keep it clean, and please visit and support the nearest town or village.\r\n\r\nTHINGS TO DO\r\nIn the closest town Nundle there are two antique stores, a homewares store, small grocers and takeaway shop, post office, Craft markets, op shop, leather shop, leadlight shop and classes, Café and Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe pool and playground are a hit with the kids. If you travel 11 Km east from Nundle to Sheba dams reserve you can swim, fossick, fish or just relax beside the water. There is also the Arc-En-Ciel Trout farm past the Sheba dams, fossicking for precious stones is also a fun way to pass the time.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES\r\nThe Reserve is serviced by the local council. There are rubbish bins and a long drop windy toilet.\r\nA large undercover area with table and chairs is very good if it is raining.\r\nDrinking water – There is no drinking water.\r\n\r\nRULES\r\nDogs are permitted on a lead and campfires are allowed following fire restrictions.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Along the east coast of Fraser Island an number of camping areas has been designated divided over different zones. Places must be pre-booked and are limited. A booking for a zone gives access to any camping area of that zone. The exact position of each camping are may change as parts of an area my be closed for regeneration. Accessibility is signposted on the beach. Many areas can be reached from the beach only; this may be impossible when the tide is high. Careful planning is therefore important. The sites have no facilities, but superb views over the sea. Like the entire island the site is accessible with a high clearance 4WD only. Poor Telstra reception.

Sites must be pre-booked. This can be done via internet or at the kiosk in the visitor centre next to the bridge. During booking you have to choose a site. Some sites are really inconvenient for campervans, because you cannot reach the site with the car. You will be bound to a small parking away from the site. Good sites are #1, #2 and #4.

We did the same tour 18 years ago. It was very beautiful, but we were shocked by the color difference: so much bleaching. We heard stories that the companies are more restricted in choosing the places to sail to to protect the reef and that therefore the most beautiful places aren't visited anymore. The snorkel safari takes you in a half circle further away from the boat with a maritime biologist. Her explanations were good (although snorkeling to see something, swimming against the current and listening to here was exhausting), but we saw little more than we saw at the general snorkeling site.

Well maintained ablutions, swimming pool, washing machine, kitchen with dishwashing possibilities. About 100 meter from the beach. Tiny shop. AUD 26 (2 adults, campervan, no electricity, low season). WiFi near the reception. WiFi was fast, but will definitely be slower in high season. Also the facilities that were perfectly right for us are probably insufficient if all sites are occupied. The main drawcard of this campground is that it is next to the boat ramp. For most overlanders this will not be important. They therefore might consider one of the two campgrounds in the village, closer to shops and tourist attractions. ",

The park is bisected by over 14km of the river in a dramatic gorge. Massive granite boulders perch high above the valley’s deep, calm pools and the swelling river rapids offer the promise of exciting adventures for intrepid canoeists.\r\nNaturally, most visitors to the park base their exploration of the park around. The park’s sense of peaceful solitude makes it a wonderful spot for long, relaxed bushwalks, birdwatching, nature photography, and self-reliant camping and hiking.\r\nThere’s plenty of space in which to camp and picnic and lots to explore, from the grassy flats beside the river to the towering ridgelines that rise high above it. You’ll find campsites nestled in the bush and a well laid out space designed specifically for scenic picnics by the river, complete with all the conveniences you'd expect.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "We are storing our campervan here during our return to Europe. The place has extreme security measures:\r\n- The exact location is only given after a storage agreement has been reached (the coordinates of this entry are in the neighbourhood, not exact). The entry looks like a farm entry like you see them so often\r\n- To enter you need a gate code that is sent the day before delivery\r\n- You are welcomed by 4 aggressive  looking dogs. You have to stay in your car until you are welcomed by the owner\r\n- The owner will guide you through a second gate with code only known to the owner. You then finally arrive at the storage terrain with many caravans, a few cars and a few containers.\r\n\r\nWe have stored our car in a 20 foot container. Fee AUD 150 per month.\r\n\r\nThe storage facility can arrange fixed price transport to the airport.\r\n\r\nCar retrieval with 24 hours advance notice.\r\n\r\nWe can make  final judgement only after we collect the car, but so far all looks good.\r\n\r\nContact: caravan-storage.com.au\r\n\r\n",

After a similar check on the scheduled day they told us immediately it would be the long job. Fortunately we could arrange accommodation. The first delivery of the clutch was wrong and one of the ordered batteries appeared to be sold, but while we were waiting in the service department they put a lot of effort in rectifying the issues and eventually we got the car on the agreed time. So far it looks like they did a good repair job. Toyota workshops are never cheap, but you get original parts and prices are fixed.",

There is also military here and they follow the Rangers at night (and guard the camp) so it's pretty safe. They are mainly here to guard the sea border but they also keep an eye on the turtle operation (government run). Park entry is 100C per person per day. we had our own toilet and shower so we didn't have to pay for camping. from santa teresa to the turn off is 20km of dirt road good quality but many shallow hard packed creek crossings fine for 2wd in dry weather. once you turn off the road which goes from santa Teresa to astillero, it gets really rough. there is a river crossing which was nearly knee deep, you need to walk it and drive over the Rocky parts, the exit was quite steep you need to search for it before you cross the river. from here the road is rough and some clearance is required. I made it in a ford E150. a tall van could be an issue as some parts of the track are not level and your vehicle will be tilted. Also very steep and not good during wet weather. from santa Teresa there are many signs along the way. It's worth the drive as it's quiet, safe and you can see the turtles.",
