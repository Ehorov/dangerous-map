    "description": "Border crossing to Mauritania, south of Tindouf. \r\n\r\nWe were the third group of tourists that used this border crossing, according to the officials here. \r\nThe total time on both sides was about 3,5 hours. It seemed like this was mainly because the officials didn’t have anything else to do, so they had no reason to hurry up. There were no “helpers” of any kind there.\r\nFirst we went to the police for getting our passports stamped.\r\nAfter this, we had to go to the customs. They wanted to know how much cash we had. And they demanded to see all of our cash. They then searched the car fairly thoroughly.\r\nI believe that after this, we were sent to the Mauritanian side.\r\nThe first post on the Mauritanian side was with the gendarmerie. They demanded 2000 DZD to register us. We were 3 people. I do not know if it was a per person fee, or per group. Nor do I know if the fee was legitimate.\r\nWe then went to get our visas. That was €55 per person. And they demanded €5 per person for the archive. Again, I do not know if the archive fee was a legitimate fee. We only got single entry visas. We forgot to ask for double entry.\r\nI believe after this we went to the customs. They asked if we had alcohol, but did not really check the car.\r\nI asked where we could get insurance for the car. They said to do it at Bir Moghrein. But we met with a couple who crossed after us. They were going to get it at Zouerat. I’m not sure if they were told so at the border. Bir Moghrein did not look like it has any insurance office, and we forgot about it there. So we will try at Zouerat or Fderik.\r\nJust before the exit, we met with the police. They wanted to know where we were going. Probably so they could know where to start looking if we went missing, and to tell the police along the way to look for us.\r\nAll in all a simple bordercrossing with no hassle, except for the Algerian customs asking us to show all of our cash. It just took some time, that’s all.",

The plane runs almost every day, you can probably get a 4x4 on the plane without too much hassle but negotiate a good price, don't let them know you have USD or are changing at black market rate as they will probably want more. At the time, a man named Alfonz was running the show, he was about 26 years old and organized everything. He did have a chief who came later and wanted more money but Alfonz smoothed it over. No customs checks or anything, just ride into the plane. No seats, not much to hold on to, takes about an hour to get to Luanda. ",

We just turned up in the early morning and got a guide on the spot, no need to book. We saw Zebra, a giraffe, some monkeys, antelope and various other kinds of deer. Definitely worth it. Best time to go is apparently early morning at 6am. We got there just before 7am and it was still good. Much later in the day is probably too hot but maybe evening is good.\r\n\r\nYou can stay at the lodge by the way. The price list said 23,000 Kwanza per person for a bungalow for two people. Maybe it’s negotiable. Camping might also be possible but we camped at Carpe Diem instead which was super nice and near enough.",

Quiet and no visitors.\r\n\r\nThe road is decent but slow going, we took about 3,5 hours from Ondjiva to this point. Most of the way it’s a well used sand road, doable with a 2wd. But from here towards Caiundo the roads turns into a deep sand track; only 4x4!",

We persevered, however, and the food was great! We got the charwama (1,200) and riz à la salade with added vegan meat (1,500) and loved them. We came back the next day for lunch.

But later 3 men came: if we wanted to sleep here we had to pay. We didn't want to sleep here, but we really thought first they must clean the place, and after ask money for sleep.\r\nBut later, when we were ready to go, I took my camera to take some pictures of the lake. They shouted us and became very aggressive because they said that we could not take pictures of the lake. Crazy. We discussed a little bit and after we went to another place.",

The staff here says that there's a museum in Ouida that’s currently open. What’s left of the museum here is just a shop of books and textiles. It also acts as a cafe, although the cafe staff is not very friendly. When I asked if there’s a book about the museum history (since the museum is closed and I came all the way), they pointed me to a book. However, to sit down and read it, they demanded me to buy something to drink at the cafe. Or I could not use the chairs and had to stand. There was no other customer and all seats were empty. In the end, I had to stand there glancing through the book. This experience left a rather bad taste in the mouth and in my few contradictory to what the foundation is about - advocating the art of Africa. For future visitors, it may best visit the museum in Ouida. ",

Perfect way to relax and recover after ‘being bush’ for a week! (UPDATED again 120pula pp) Campsite itself is very popular and thus busy, even in low season, and we didn’t like the pitches that much. (in fact oy a few are anywhere near level) Although every site is private and trees do separate one site from another, it was all very near to each other (very near!!!). After being in the wild one week being with all the space and quietness, it was not very nice here. Too many people, too much noise, too little space. Also you don’t get to choose your own spot. Even if you book a spot well in advance they will mess up your booking. Twice this happened to us.  \r\nIf you can ask for Site 3 lots of headroom for RTT shade and near abolition block.  ",

    "description": "From Botswana to Zambia... It was very quiet when we were here around lunch time. Some counters we not manned and we had to go to the \"commercial\" building. That's the building for the trucks. When you drive over the bridge you can overtake the trucks. Sometimes the road only had one lane, so take care you don't get stuck in between trucks. Both the Botswana and Zambian border are in the same building, but some things you have to do outside this building. Exiting Botswana is easy. It's free. 1. Immigration will check your passport. 2. Customs will stamp your Carnet de Passages. Entering Zambia is more challenging but you don't need an fixer. 1. The health counter will check and register your Covid PCR-test. No costs involved. A PCR test can be taken near the weight bridge in Kasane. Read the instructions how to do that in iOverlander. 2. The next counter is the road police. Nobody there, so we skipped it. 3. Pay the road tax at the RTSA counter. We paid US$20. 4. The next counter is called \"Immigration extensions\". This counter can be skipped. 5. The next counter is called \"Immigration\". Buy your KAZA visa for US$50 per person. Children are free for Zambia. Beware that you need a visa for the children when you also want to enter Zimbabwe (US$30 for a single entry). 6. Then there is the \"Customs\" counter. If you have an Carnet de Passage they will send you to Interpol in another building. It's called \"Car inspection\". No signs from Interpol. Some questions were asked, some things registers in their computer and we got an stamp on the back of the slip of the Carnet. No costs involved. 7. Back to the \"Customs\" counter and they will stamp the Carnet de Passage. No costs involved. 8. At the last counter you have to pay \"Carbon tax\" and \"Bridge toll\". Here is the \"ugly fat\" guy called Paul. The bridge toll is cheaper in US$ so we paid the US$20. Then Paul has some difficulty to understand that tourists also exit an country and because of that he wants to charge 660 kwatcha. When you only travel through the country (transit) and don't stay somewhere the carbon tax is 660 kwatcha. When you visit as a tourist and tell him you go to Livingstone (for example) then it's 330 kwatcha. If Paul doesn't want to cooperate, complain at the Customs office (previous counter) because they will correct him. There is an ATM outside with kwatchas. The fee for the ATM is 50 kwatcha. 9. Congratulations you passed all the counters. But there is more... 10.You have to buy third party liability insurance. I think there is only one building where you can buy this. It's next to the ATM. They don't have an COMESA insurance. We already got an insurance for all Africa so we took the gamble and skipped this. No one checked. We were not checked at one of the road blocks to Livingstone. 11. Now you can drive to the exit gate. Be prepared that at least three different officials will approach you at the same time. One will check the Carnet de Passage, bridge toll and carbon tax. Another will check the road toll. The last guy will ask for the council levy of 50 kwatcha. 12. ... and now you are really free to go. You can do it easily without touts. It can takes some time. Road tax: US$20 (KAZA UNI)VISA: US$50 per adult ( Carbon tax: US$20 for an 3.0 liter car Bridge toll: US$20 ATM charge: 50 kwatcha (or change at one of the touts) Road toll: 330 kwatcha for an 4x4 Council levy: 50 kwatcha\r\n\r\nNOTE: KAZA Visa valid only for entry in the Vic Falls area. Any other border post you need to pay again. ",

As the site is somewhat away from the cave and not anywhere near the main track from Xai xai to the A35 it is very quiet and secluded. \nNote however that they are building a campsite, entrance gate and visitor center at the time of this writing and when I woke up the next morning some guardians arrived at my camp demanding that I pay for camping (80 p; no facilities at the moment!) and entrance to the area (210 p).

We did not pay any fine and eventually left after just purchasing the permit. My advice . . . . If you do not have permit issued on entry then go to the police station in Katima and request one there BEFORE attempting this border without.\r\n\r\nFor entry into Botswana . . . . . .. .  .reasonable easy formalities, pleasant enough staff, friendly and helpful, need to buy vehicle insurance and road permit, for under 3500kg this costs 100 + 221 (pula) (insurance valid for year, permit for 1 month). The talked about \"entry tax\" that was supposed to be implemented from June 1st 2017 has at this point in time been indefinitely postponed.\r\nIf this does get implemented then it will be 30 US$ per person.\r\nPossible to make any payments with either card or any currency.\r\nFoot and Mouth check here too. Disinfect shoes and an enquire of \"do you have any meat ?\". Though the inspector looked inside vehicle there was no actual checking inside any boxes or even the fridge, of course we had already told him we are vegetarian !",

Their service, as with every other company, simply offers you the transport to and from Victoria Falls. We couldn’t find anything cheaper or better and we shopped around a fair bit. Definitely recommend that you don’t book the shuttle through your lodge or where you are staying as they will charge almost double and then use these companies! \n\nWhen we arrived at the border, there was a long queue, estimated waiting time of about two hours. Our driver said that if we wanted, we could pay USD$5 each as a bribe to the officials so that we could jump the queue. There is even a seperate entrance for people who pay this . We decided to do this. Waited 20 minutes instead and driver organised everything. Hassle free. Obviously you don’t have to do this if you don’t want, but be aware that is an option. Of course where the money actually goes is also unknown! \n\nOverall the service and shuttle was nothing out of the ordinary or special. But the driver made the border crossings easy. \n\nJames the manager is super friendly and you can discuss with him what you want. They offer game drives and and boat cruises too. \n\nTheir stand is located just outside the Chobe Safari Lodge. +267 76039813. \n\n* you can leave your vehicle at the chobe safari lodge parking which has a security guard.

The receptionist was extremely helpful and she organised for one of the guys to take us in one of their work cars to get money out from an ATM while they worked on our car (as we just arrived from Plumtree border). All staff super friendly and professional. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The place had not been visited for a long time, maybe a couple of weeks. We camped anyway and the next day we arrived at Zutshwa to find the self permit station. We thought we could get a permit for the previous night, and pay for traveling on the road to Zutshwa. The result - the self-service permit station at Zutshwa had no permits. They couldn't even meet that basic requirements of providing the blank permits so you could pay for one. So take your chances if you want to camp. They can't keep the permits in stock, I really doubt they are out checking the campsites. No facilities other than space to camp, but lots of evidence of animals, however we didn't see many.",

You can still use your own camera equipment but what they provide you with is also great to get good shots. \r\nIf you're new to photography this is as well a nice tour as you will be guided and they teach you as much as you like about wildlife photography. Or you just use the camera to get to see more details of the animals you're looking at thanks to the zoom. And there is sooo much to see at the Chobe River! \r\nThe guides are not just very knowledgeable when it comes to photography but also the animals you get to see.\r\nAt the end you get to take the memory card with the pictures you took.\r\nWe had a wonderful experience!",

First 3 times in Cameroon before they opened the barrier, but all people are friendly and no one asked for money. \nIn Gabon we had to go to the police first, where we had to fill out one immigration form each. There was an official with glasses, but he didn't made any problems. When he asked for our hotel reservation we just said that we are camping and therefore go to a campground in Libreville that we couldn't book upfront. He was ok with that, took down our details and let us go. \nA few meters further on the right is customs, where we got our carnet stamped without problems. After that our details were written down 2 more times from police, but eventually all was fine and we could continue. Passports gotten stamped in Bitam. \nSo if you don't have a valid hotel booking and want to skip the police check at the other border we highly recommend to use this border. It also takes some time, but in the end we didn't had a y problems here. ",

We had to go to the Chief of littoral 1 customs sector (highest chief in Douala) to get approval to use out carnet. From him we had to go back to all lower chiefs, after the 5th offices they stamped our carnet. Then release from the PAD, same story for hours no progress. when the boss arrived it was fixed. To pay 50k port duties, that is on the other side if the port. Pay the handling costs at Socomar (700Euro) and get your car. It took us 3 whole working days to get this done.\nHope for others that we paved the path. They admitted that is was straight forward but new to them and then you need to speak to the boss of the boss.",
