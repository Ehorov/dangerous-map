They can heat up the water for shower and there are flush toilets as well as long drop ones. Not very clean… There’s also a kitchen guests can use. The dinner was 5000 franks pp with soup, main, tea and fruits for desert. They also sell cold beer. They can switch on the WiFi if you ask nicely :) \nIn the evening they made a fire for us. \nYou can rent a bicycle for 20$ (3-5 hours) or go on an ecotour for 25$ with them. \nThe road to the campsite is a bit steep, but cars do go up. Motorcycles went up fine. Maybe it can get slippery after a heavy rain though... IMPORTANT it’s not really suitable for cars with a rooftoptent. You will have to camp on the parking lot.",

He brings you around in Goma, and will take you to any  hotel depending on your price and comfort level, and will make sure the price is right. Any questions or requests, they can make sure it met.\n\nThey've got a proper Land Cruiser in Goma to bring you around and to the treks. Brought us back to Rwanda and stayed with us through the immigration process.\n\nCan't speak highly enough of the service. Suberb from A to B.

We used the toilets in the restaurant and the shower in one of the rooms. They’ll boil water if you want a hot shower. \r\n\r\nHard to find a spot where you can be leveled for your roof top tent, but there’s a lot of flat rocks around to level out the car. \r\n\r\nAs it’s a lodge, food is on the expensive side, about 7000 for dinner and the same for breakfast.\r\n\r\nStaff is super friendly, all of them! They do everything to make you comfortable. \r\n\r\nLast 10 minutes is bad road. A 4x4 is needed, or at the very least a car with high ground clearance. I wouldn’t want to do it without low gears.

They called their chief and anyone they could reach, and within an hour there were regular people trying to help us as long as we paid for the temporary permit; Martin kept on saying we only had 50 euros to spend and so of course, nobody wanted to help us for that price.\r\n\r\nWith the language barrier, we talked with the sweet border official and asked him what the possibilities were? Was the temporary permit really the only possibility? \r\nHe said that two weeks prior to our arrival, other travelers had the same problem and they left their car at the border and talked to the chief in St. Louis personally; this way they managed to figure something out.\r\nBut he did not know which price they paid or anything else about them.\r\n\r\nWe took a cab to St.Louis (2000 CFA when shared) and got a hotel in St.Louis, got on the public WIFI and called as many offices as possible as well as the Dutch Embassy. Martin found the government website of Senegal and filed a complaint because the website stated that tourists can get a temporary permit easily at the border; which obviously did not happen easily.\r\n\r\nOn Monday we decided to talk to the chief at the Duane Regional Point Nord, he was extremely friendly and first asked us to explain everything. Because we saw he was Muslim due to the Arabic paintings hanging around we used as much ‘Bismillah’  ‘ Inshaallah’ and ‘Alhamdullilah’ as possible. \r\nHe gave us two options; either a free five days to Dakar and back to the Diama border crossing, or an escort that would guide us, around Gambia, to the Guinee border. \r\nThe escort normally costs 150 euros, but because he ‘wanted to help other Muslims out’, he wouldn’t mind paying half of it. After Martin only put a 50 euro note on the table, he put 100 euros worth of CFA on the table, said that we should take all the money to the border where we’d pay for the escort.\r\nAfterwards, the escort would come with us and we’d have to get an official document at the Duane Regional Point Sud before we could drive south to Guinee.\r\n\r\nIt was too good to be true, but when we returned at the border, everything was arranged, we paid; the officials got the official document for us and we were able to drive off to Guinee with an escort in our car.\r\nBefore we left, the border officials were mad at us and asked us why we filed a complaint on the government website stating they’re corrupt and were asking money, and why we called the embassy.\r\nMartin kept on saying that his dad is an ambassador so that he might have called. \r\nIn the end, we don’t know why everything happened quickly and easily; was it all just because of the complaint that Martin filed or really because we grew up Muslim?\r\nWe managed to get our car, older then 2008, through Senegal with an escort for only 50 euros.\r\n",

    "description": "On my way to Cape Town I stopped here. Lamin and his sister are having a small souvenir shop here. They offered me to sleep beside their shop for free. Lamin is super easy. There is free WiFi 24/7 from the near by hotel, also 230v from Lamin’s shop (if you give him small money) and a public tap for water. The mangroves are 100m walk from Lamin’s shop. Lamin often starts a fire in the night to preparing good fish and tea. You are welcome. It’s little paradise. There are some mosquitos because of the mangroves. Btw he offered me a cheap 2h boad ride through the mangroves. He also runs a facebook page “Discover Senegal and Gambia with Lamin”. Super low fares! Feel free to support him, last shop at the street! At the weekends it can be a little bit louder because of local music. But not too loud! ",

Big rigs may struggle to get onto campsite but there are plenty of other spaces to park under the trees, alongside the site itself. Khotso has over a hundred horses and specialises in a variety of horse trails. Lots of nice walks around farm and slightly further afield, some great hiking in the Drakensberg mountains ( e.g. Garden Castle and Cobham KZN reserves). Typical, friendly backpacker style atmosphere with good, hearty breakfast and dinner available if required. Very easy place to stay for more than just a few days.

For more adventure, you can drive from Kosi Bay on sandy tracks through the park. The rate through Nov 2017 is R124 per adult, 50% off for kids under 12. Plus a one-time park fee of R25 per adult, R25 per vehicle and R15 per child. On weekends and holidays, minimum charge per campsite is 4 adults. \nLeatherback and loggerhead turtles nest here, and turtle viewing tours are available.

The campsite has over 50 large sites on a grassy lawn, each with a brick braai stand. No electricity. The only trash cans are by the ablutions. The unusual thing is that there is just one ablutions block, which is located across a stream from most of the sites. We had a lot of fun marching over the swinging suspension bridge to use the ablutions each evening. Ablutions are clean \u0026 reasonably well maintained. \r\nThe best way to get here is to take the N2 to Idutywa -- Willowvale -- gravel road to Dwesa. It's very well signposted. The road was in good condition but apparently it can be bad when wet. Cost to camp is R233 per site per night. Conservation fee included",

And then ...  give the receipt to guard at Millers Point for entry. We did not know this and wasted an hour driving back to Fish Hoek ... but eventually worth it. Grounds and ablutions (bathtub, too) and scullery kept very tidy and cleaned daily. Famous fish restaurant (Black Marlin) next to camp--moderate prices, decent food. Phone: 021 7825503, 021 7861142",

The owner, Melissa, is more than happy to tell you all about it. \r\n\r\n0027824110448\r\nIt is advisable to call ahead of your stay if there is room in the lodges.

Campground is nice but hard to find even land, sometimes it’s very windy and then it can be hard to find a place without wind. Owners are very nice and always around. Nice kitchen with everything you need and a VERY nice living area with a fireplace and amazing view. Free WiFi. Typical backpackers with a nice calm vibe, a hundred times better than the soulless South African caravan parks. R100 pppn for camping and it’s totally recommended! ",

It's run by Anthony and Spider who offer excellent service at reasonable prices.\r\nOn my Toyota Prado I had new front discs and pads fitted, the rear discs skimmed, rear pads fitted, a handbrake drum skimmed, handbrake shoes re-lined, a rear axle oil seal replaced and some welding done and was extremely pleased with the workmanship and service given.\r\nThey will work on any vehicle and go above and beyond to either locate or even make parts - they made a special clip to hold the handbrake shoes in for me as it was missing and one couldn't be easily obtained in South Africa.\r\nThey even rang me a couple of hours after completing the work to ensure I was happy with the way the brakes were performing.  I would highly recommend this garage.",

Hiking and 4x4 trails, firewood for sale. Best to book in advance (email: info@timbila.co.za). They also have tented and cabin type self catering accommodation next to a river in the reserve but currently the area is suffering from the widespread drought in this part of RSA so the river was dry during our stay. Highly recommended if you like the solitude and peace of the bush.

There is only one hot shower and a single toilet for the camp which may be a problem as camping is also allowed next to and on the disused airstrip not far from the main camp but there are no facilities there. The cost to camp is R120 per person per night on either the main campsite or the air strip. Great location but quite a way from any public amenities such as fuel stations. Activities: relaxing, hiking, mountain biking, star gazing. Access is on gravel roads which vary in condition from good to not so good. NB! There is no through route north east from Enjo as the river crossing 17 kms  along the gravel road is normally too deep in the rainfall winter months.\r\nAll vehicle access.  Firewood available for purchase.  Main farmhouse has an honesty bar selling drinks and snacks.",

We were sitting outside together for a while, it was nice and friendly with her partner and their friends. We went to repark the car. When we came back after 5 minutes all lights were turned off, there was nobody and no internet. Is was 7 pm and she switched off everything. We kindly asked her for switching in on because we really needed it. She told us that it's mountains and she has no energy (ok but she should have told us this, she new we are here for the internet) and if we don't like it she will open the gate and we have to leave. Her tone was very rude. It was totally dark, it's mountain curved road to go and we already drink a beer that she gave us. When we started to discuss and negotiate the price she told us she is going to call POLICE. So we payed for 2 small beers (90 rands!!!!!), left her possetion angry and stayed for a night next to the road. 100% UNRECOMMENDED place. So if you have to stay somewhere here choose different place (there are few) or stay wild because we were told it's safe area.",

Frequented by friendly and fun locals, especially over the weekend. Sometimes a band would play here. \r\n\r\nThis place has an apocalyptic feel to it and is a home to the yearly AfrikaBurn festival (like the Burning Man in the US). The structures from the festival still stand all around the territory. Never saw anything like this before, probably the coolest venue we have visited coming from Europe to Cape Town... Very rustic, cozy and basic. Though, in the middle of a desert, so don’t expect much luxury :)\r\n\r\nRun by incredibly helpful and friendly people. \r\nYou have to ask for a “snuff” at the bar!\r\n\r\nNo cellphone reception, but there is a reasonable wifi for a fee. \r\n\r\nThere is a tyre shop and they also always have some fuel for the bikes. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is a must see place while in South Africa.

We have a small fenced off lawned camping area as well as 4 double rooms, a licensed restaurant that serves gourmet burgers and breakfast. It is manned by the two owners, Debi \u0026 Eugene. We offer safe camping in a garden setting with good views. \r\n\r\n*PLEASE NOTE* Our campsite is ONLY suitable for tents, no vehicles and no 4 x 4 vehicles with rooftop tents, RVs, caravans or any other vehicle that requires level ground. \r\n\r\nThere are 4 lawned terraces 4m wide and 30m long and offer some shade with a few  trees. There is no vehicle access so you cannot park next to your tent, you would need to carry your tent to the terraces from the parking area.  There is an electrical power point on each terrace. You have the use of a very basic outside kitchen with kettle and washing up facilities. The ablutions are in the same building with two showers, two wash basins and two loos. The facilities are shared between men and ladies. Corrugated sheeting separates the kitchen area, loos and showers. There are 2 braai /BBQ areas but they are separate from the campsite, one opposite the ablutions and the other close to the restaurant. We sell wood at R30 per bag. We do not allow own alcohol as we are fully licensed, we also have our own pets so cannot allow yours.\r\n\r\nREGULAR rates \r\nR810 per double room (R405 per person per night sharing) (Excluding meals)\r\nR505 single rate per person (Excluding meals) \r\nLower WINTER rates (1 June 2018 - 31 Aug 2018)\r\nCamping R85 per person per night\r\nNo caravans and/or 4 x 4 vehicles with rooftop tents can be accommodated due to the slope of the property.",

For once, this restaurant is frequented by all the people. it is both popular but also very popular and well known. We have a great evening. Food, atmosphere, decor, everything is perfect. Since we are in South Africa, we go to the restaurant frequently. The reason is that you eat well and that prices are affordable. Hard to find a place in the world where you can make a meal as rich and tasty as tonight for 20 €.

There is only one place to camp in the park and that is at Algeria but you can camp just south of the park at Sanddrif (check in at Dwarsrivier Winery) or Cederberg Park at Kromrivier (where we camped).  They are all crazy expensive, for instance at Kromrivier they asked for R520 for 2 people but agreed to 350. You also have to pay for individual walks and get permits which give you the combination to the locked gates.  The Maltese Cross walk, for instance,  costs R70 pp, the rock art is 50 pp (the price list says its R70pp to picnic!).  You can enter the park from the south via Ceres or the north from Clanwilliam.  There are no entry fees if you are just passing through. The third way in is off the N7 about 20 km south of Clanwilliam, follow signs for Algeria.   This third way is the fastest in/out of the park from Cape Town. But it's all worth it - the park is stunningly beautiful!",

There are signboards so it’s easy to find.\r\n\r\nThis place is obviously used as playground for the guys :-) \r\n\r\nAs the guys like to come here for racing cars and bikes, the set up is also made for partying in the middle of nowhere. Very special. \r\n\r\nModern ablution block. \r\nBesides running water and flushing toilets (4) (even a male and female section) (clean and fairly new)- hot water from a donkey for the 4 showers- you will find a big communal area with a big fire place and bar set up (inkl. Fridge and kitchen sink) and shade. Sandy surface. The whole set up is also protecting nicely from wind and sun. Fridge and Light are running on solar. \r\n\r\nIt’s like a small open air rockers club in the desert :-)\r\n\r\nCamping is 120 pppn.\r\nA bag of wood 10 ZAR. \r\n\r\nNo signal. Digital detox.",

    "description": "The most unpleasant embassy in which we were. The arrogant attitude of all employees and Vice Consul K. Dąbrowska. We wanted to make temporary passports to get back to Poland on the western coast. Like many Polish travelers, we wanted to keep the \"old\" passport in case there was no temporary passport in one country. We did not get permission for that. The old passport had to be canceled immediately. We therefore applied for a biometric passport - 1700 rand per person and 6 weeks of waiting. The passport can then be picked up by courier, sending the old one to be canceled.\r\nThe consul also refused to give us a consular note that could help in obtaining a visa to the DRC, Cameroon or Nigeria.\r\nUnfortunately, they are under it: Namibia, Lesotho, Swazi, Botswana and Zambia.\r\nIf you can settle consular matters in Angola or Tanzania, do it. The consuls there are much more forgiving for travelers.\r\n----\r\nNajbardziej nieprzyjemna ambasada w jakiej byliśmy. Aroganckie podejście wszystkich pracowników oraz Vice Konsul K. Dąbrowskiej. Chcieliśmy wyrobić paszporty tymczasowe, aby wrócić do Polski zachodnim wybrzeżem. Tak jak wielu podróżników także polskich chcieliśmy zatrzymać \"stary\" paszport na wypadek gdyby w którymś kraju nie był uznawany paszport tymczasowy. Nie uzyskaliśmy na to zgody. Stary paszport musiał być natychmiast anulowany. Złożyliśmy zatem wniosek o paszport biometryczny - 1700 randów od osoby i 6 tygodni oczekiwania. Paszport można potem odebrać kurierem przesyłając stary do anulowania.  \r\nKonsul nie zgodziła się także wydać nam noty konsularnej, która mogłaby pomóc w otrzymaniu wizy do DRK, Kamerunu czy Nigerii.\r\nNiestety podlegają pod nią: Namibia, Lesotho, Swazi, Botswana i Zambia. \r\nJeśli możecie załatwić sprawy konsularne w Angoli czy Tanzanii zróbcie to.

If you arrive at this entrance call Robin on +27 82 956 4175 to open the gate. \r\n\r\nCamping with the wolves is offered for 100R pppn (or voluntary donation, just talk to Robin) and there are ablutions, power, and water. Not sure about showers. \r\n\r\nYou actually camp between wolf enclosures and you can listen to them howl at night. Beautiful. Hiking huts (byo linen) and a fully furnished cabin are available too.\r\n\r\nWolf tours are 100% worth it and you can pet/scratch some of them, lovely animals. \r\n\r\nRobin, Raven, and Andrew are really knowledgeable and passionate about this Sanctuary and it's a great cause to support.

It is regarded as an engineering triumph, with a sequence of bends and twists that can only give rise to admiration for the gold rush pioneers of the late 19th century that carved this route through the mountains with their wagons. The pass has 62 bends, corners and curves of which 12 exceed an arc of 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe pass also includes a 133 metre-long tunnel, named after J.G. (Hans) Strydom, who served as the prime minister of South Africa from 1954 to 1958. This huge pass is over 24 km long and has an altitude variance of 737 metres; the road surface is in a good condition, but the pass is sometimes plagued by heavy traffic. It can be very difficult to pass slow-moving trucks – please exercise a degree of tolerance and patience, and give yourself plenty of time to traverse this route.",

We saw maybe 2 or 3 people. No one bothered us. A friendly gentleman came to greet us and showed us where the water was (near the old generator) and we think he explained that other people will also be arriving the next day. We had enough water in our tanks and did not need to use the water so I can’t comment on the quality. We had a great night here, great views, some shade, not sure if really big overlanders will be able to make the drive to the spot. We have an Iveco daily 4x4 and we were ok in terms of width but parts of the path was narrow. ",

Access to the beach is by car and going through Utshwayelo Kosi bay resort which provides the permit to the beach and manages the bush camp bookings. All excursions eg turtle viewing and lake boat trip and fish trap tour can be booked from here too. \r\nLarge rigs will have a problem to park here. Access is with a 4x4 due to sand and high clearance needed.  Not difficult. \r\nShopping is done at Manguzi, the closest town. \r\nWe stayed a week and there is still work to be done on the camp to get the value for the price paid. ( currently overpriced). ",

We initially thought one ... maybe two nights, but stayed for three nights ... and would have loved to stay one more, if our schedule would not have demanded us to move on. Allie and Peter are ever so nice and helpful and interested to meet travelers. If we ever are in the area again, we certainly come back to McGregor and YellowStone Cottages\r\nThis place is recommended for overlanders who once in a while wish to stay in ‚normal‘ accommodation – not meant for overnighting in the camping van.

Everything is neat and tidy although there was some building work in progress on new accommodation when we were there. Cristiaan, the son of the owner, was very friendly and although the site was heavily booked when we stayed, he managed to find a spot for us to camp. Unfortunately, due to the stands being close together, if your neighbours stay up to well after 11pm talking and laughing, you won't get to sleep till they do. They also accommodate overland truck groups from time to time so again noise may be an issue. That said, the facilities and location are great. Very nice looking modern chalet accommodation too.",

Beautiful Star Wars themed bathroom facilities, braai and heated swimming pool, private lapas, 12V and USB power.  - high quality and lovely vistas over Nieuwoudtville from between the rocks of the koppie (hill) where it is situated.\r\n What a unique place! But unfortunately it was fully booked. The owner offered us a \"wild\" campsite near his place. We could use a clean and modern shower + toilet. We paid 150 ppn, normal rate is 200 R. The friendly owner showed us his farm, very exciting. Place your booking in advance during the flower season, via Facebook or homepage. Ore: Call 079 538 6822 bookings@starwors.net",

They will check your TIP and car and will keep the TIP. After that there's immigration in a small container across the road, after passing the fence.  You'll get an easy stamp out.\r\n\r\nSudanese enter:\r\nBefore being able to pass the security guard you have to show your Carnet.\r\nThen you can pass and go to immigration on the left hand side where you already see benches and people sitting.

Then you have to fill out a small form and they stamp you in.\r\n\r\nAfter immigration you drive further to where you can see 'customs' painted on a white wall. Park your car and enter the big building in the back.Y ou have to walk to the building in the back and then walk all the way to the back of the building and just call around until somebody answers. \r\nThey'll check the Carnet and your car, will take a while to copy and put a signature etc. they'll ask the end destination(never say 'Israel'!). \r\n\r\nAfter that you'll get a paper that you'll have to hand over to customs when exiting the country.\r\n\r\nThe Carnet you also have to hand back to Midhat Mahir('s colleagues) when exiting, otherwise he has to pay a fine!(which already happened to him so he was a bit reluctant with helping us)\r\nAnd that is that!\r\n\r\nFor any questions about the Carnet you can email us: shakuramj@gmail.com or mij.name.is.nobody@gmail.com",

In the 2 days we drove up from Khartoum to Sawakin, Oemar already arranged our ferry tickets.\r\n\r\nExiting Sudan:\r\nWhen arriving in Sawakins port we called Oemar and he arrived within 10 minutes to help us. He needed our passports and carnet, explained a little bit and was on his way very quick and fast. After 3 hours we could drive up to the ferry and handed over the Sudanese carnet to Oemar so he would send it back to Midhat.\r\n\r\nYou have to leave the car key in the car for the drivers to drive the car in and out of the ferry(nothing was stolen).\r\n\r\nThe ferrytickets for 2 people incl. the car and Oemar's services costed us SP.4600,- \r\n\r\nWe were happy with the service of both Midhat and Oemar. We advice to book a fixer via Midhat, as you'll know for sure you will not be disappointed and arrange a fixed price.\r\n\r\nEntering Saudi:\r\nWe arrived around 10AM and left the ferry 11AM to go through immigration very easily. No need to fill out a form.\r\n\r\nAfter that the waiting for customs began; after 2 hours there were 2 men that handed over port clearance papers(SR. 270,- but you can pay in USD and can also exchange USD with them if no other option) with which you'd be able to arrange a TIP(free) and insurance(min. a week for SR.140,-). After arranging all the paperwork we had to wait another 3.5 hours for the cars to finally be cleared.

With the actual black market rate it is about 150$. People in Khartoum and Port Sudan asked for 350$ so better pay in Sudan£. I arrived on saturday and took the ferry on sunday evening. On Sudnay morning I went back to the office for registering my ticket for this day. \r\n\r\nAt 2pm I drove up to the port, show your ticket at the gate. After that ride to the customs building just 100m left. They take you carnet and give you some letter in arabic. After that continue straight on the termac road. You will come to another gate, turn left on the dirt road until you come to the next gate. Here you park your car and go for immigration. Three different steps for the exit stamp. At first in the big building straight and after that the small building on the other side of the outdoor hall. Pay 45Sudan£ for some „exit ticket“. After collecting two stamps on the form and the „ticket“ you are ready for the passport stamp inside the big building again. \r\n\r\nAfter being a stamp collector you can drive your car in the area for boarding ;).\r\n\r\nNo fixer needed. Police is also speaking english sometimes and friendly.\r\n\r\nBe aware that in august and end of july it can be very busy because of Hajj season. ",

European toilets, can buy a little water here. 140km of bad dirt road to get here, it took us over 6 hours. Great scenery and awesome locals. If you can ride motorcycle off-road then you will enjoy this. Gravel roads, sand patches and patches of rock. There are trucks and buses driving the roads so fine for  4x4. Wild animals next to the roads. Lake Natron has flamingoes. Come to spend a few days. You need to brig water, cash and enough fuel to get out again. Wifi avalaible at $2.50 per hour. No cell reception. There are three gates to pass on route at costs of $10pp, $10pp and $15pp with a vehicle fee for cars. To visit the lake costs $20pp with your own vehicle for the guide. They can provide food for $28 for full board or you can cook yourself. Three dogs on site and a kitten.

The only reason you are in Dar is for Zanzibar and/or to sort some things out.This is your way out: Close to the city but feels like being in the bush. You can pick your own camp spot right on the beach. Shady spots are created by wooden structures with palm leaf roofs. Amazing swimming with high tide. Just started and run by three young inspirational minds: Ali, Fani and Naima. The vibes the place is giving of are: a little Rastafarian, Woodstockish, with a dash of Ibiza beach club with a backpackers mindset.It's basic but they make you feel home. If your lucky and interested you might get invited for tea, a free morning workout session, or a outdoor cinema where they are projecting old and new movies on the beach.The restaurant offers basic meals. Simple but fresh and tasty. (10.000 - 15.000)Price for camping (2.000)Price for safari tent (10 USD)",

If you haven't got a visa you will be escorted to a back office where your passport gets checked and the application forms have to be filled in.

If you need an insurance ask at the NBC bank for a person to guide you ( this is a free service!). They want to get rid of all the \"fixers\" which have been hanging around in the old days.\r\nOtherwise I marked one official insurance office separate.\r\nBefore you leave the premises there is a check point where you fill your details in a book.

UNESCO Heritage site and 2nd most important rock painting site of whole Africa! Costs were 30000 TSH for guide, 27.000 TSH per person entrance. We needed to hire a bike for the guide (15.000 TSH) as we were there with only 1 bmw GS 1200. Path is about 9 km and quite heavy off-road. You need 4x4 and off-road experience (stones, rocks, sand). If you don't have 4x4 you can sit in back on the motorcycle of the guide, bumpy ride and painful ass but it will work ;-). View from up there is magnificent!

This place is secured with a fence and guards patrolling the area. Staff is very friendly and if you want to see the village you are more than welcome to come along.\r\n\r\nFor camping don’t expect anything to fancy as this was there first time having overlanders over. No braai, but you can make a fire on the sandy surface. There is a toilet, but outdated. No hot shower, but only a cold one close to the beach.

Not welcoming if you ask something and not around a lot, which can be annoying (in our case we had no water for almost a day, he needs to turn on the pump for that...). Parking should be possible but very low (2,20m) entrance. The accommodation is nice for the price, but don’t expect anything more than that from the host/premises. ",

It is really spectacular! The crater lake is surrounded by forest and completely untouched. At the lake viewpoint there are several picnic benches.\r\n\r\nThere’s an official at the starting point wearing a full length green uniform who you pay the money to. He wasn’t able to give a receipt but it was clear he was legitimate. He can also guide you to the viewpoint if you like and give you the history of the lake. He accompanied us and we tipped him 10,000 shillings. Really nice guy called diamond.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to camp at the trek starting point but there isn’t a view of the lake.\r\n\r\nTo get here - the turning point is just south of Mbeya (think it’s called Uyole - will mark it on ioverlander too). Basically you approach the lake from the North East.\r\n",

The place, a boulders moutain surrounded by hot springs, facing the Eyasi escarpment is wonderful. The group of Hazda living there is not supposed to welcome tourists who have not checked in with the tourism office ahead. They only speak kiswahili. After negotiation they allowed us to stay here for the night for 100 000 tzs. We finally paid 60 000 for the night (considering it included the \"cultural encounter\" we would have paid for from the village) and gave them some food, clothes and utensils (they really have nothing). During dinner the 2 men came to our car and we had a chat and we shared some food again. For breakfast they were 6. They were nice and friendly but kept asking for food and money. We can't recommend this place to non-swahili speakers or people not ready to share their food. I am also not sure of long term consequences of this kind of arrangement if the tourism office knows about it.The Hazda people living here in their hut \"behind the scene\" are just extremely poor and I don't know what they get from the tourism activity managed from the nearby village.",

    "description": "Price is 10 usd pp for the Forest Reserve + 10 usd for a ranger for the night. No especial fees for camping on top of that. If you want to hike a guide is mandatory and also costs 10 usd. The official campsite is located under a bamboo forest close to this beautiful lake and about 100mts from where you park the car. Because of our rooftop tent we camped at the parking by the lake which I preferred because of the view. Many birds, fish eagle, monkeys on the trees. Feels wild! Nice escape from Dar. Pit toilets available. No showers. Water can be arranged but no tap water.",

At first they tried to charge us more than a room for our own tent, but got it down to 15,000tsh for both of us. Food was cheap but took 1.5hours and came cold with bugs on. Menu was covered in mud too, weirdly (see photo). The camp spot they had given us turned out to be the walkway between a local bar and the toilets, so lots of people walking past our tent and bike. Having taken our money and directed us to camp there, I feel the staff could have directed people around the gate, which is the same distance to the toilet. But no, they deliberately made the area next to our tent the walkway. Didn’t really feel very safe. Even in the morning when all the guests from the bar had gone, staff stood around our tent chatting in the early hours. Once they had our money they were generally very inconsiderate. Toilets were squat and hadn’t seen a mop for some time, no offer of showers. There’s a car park which would probably be fine if in a van. \r\nWould only stay here as a last resort… Maybe not even then.",

Reporting time is 19:30pm, departing time 21pm. Normally arrives in Bukoba around 6-6:30am. There is a restaurant and bar on board, quite lively with Tanzanian music and alcohol flowing freely. I stayed in first class, which was on the first floor. Bunk bed, neat, clean sheets and a functioning plug and small desk. Recommended to buy first and second class tickets a view days in advance since they tend to sell out. We entered with 2 bicycles which they weighed before boarding, total costs for the bikes was 16.000. Possible to enter with a car as well, they told me for a land cruiser it is around 150.000 but depends on the weight.  All in all good experience! ",

And organise your trip from here . Cost much less than the normal tour places in town. \r\nAll the boats move together the whole day . \r\nSandbank stop with fruit \r\nSnorkel next to island in a semi lagoon( no fish)\r\nIsland fish lunch and few stalls. \r\nPrice range from 30 us to 70 us depending on where you book. \r\nBut all companies move together the whole day. We booked through Sinbad tours but you can get it cheaper . \r\n",

First they asked 20 dollar and when I told them it is too much they told me to pay what i can afford. I gave them 25.000 shilling including breakfast",

Meals are available from 15000, but I didn't try them. There's a local restaurant just in front, and a rolex stall just down the road.

Asiimwe Lucky, the director and founder of the Kitojo Vocational School works as a guide and has great knowledge of the area around the lake. Lucky felt a specific burden for the young girls working at the quarries because, in addition to the work hazards and low income, they were frequent victims of sexual assault. Kijoto training school is now offering its grounds and welcomes overlanders.The facilities are very basic and therefore you are only expected to make a small donation to the school at the end of your stay.Lake  Bunyonyi can be the perfect place to unwind after your trek to the nearby gorillas.

Received proof of the fact. 6) TZ customs: completed and signed CDP. Received TIP form for payment. 7) Proceed to NMB bank desk to pay TIP (USD 20 equivalent for one month). Only accept TZ Shillings so changed USD for TZ Shillings and while there changed the UG Shillings for TZ Shillings. The bank does the exchange for you like any normal forex. 8) Took form back to TZ Customs and stamped the vehicle in. 9) Drive to gate where security personnel check TIP and let you proceed. Quite efficient. Allow for 90 to 120 minutes. [NOTE: crossing this border as at 5 June 2020 was only permitted through prior arranged Ugandan governmental authorization].",

However, they charged $40 just for tent camping and that is way too much in our opinion. We found this place, a nice and quiet hotel with rooms situated around a green courtyard. A double room + breakfast for 2 goes for 90.000 ush (its also on booking.com, same room goes for $35 there). Slow wifi but it works, hot water and a bath tub, flushing toilet and rooms have tv. All have a little veranda with a table and chairs on which you are allowed to cook your own food. Well stocked bar (beer @4000) and a very reasonably priced menu (havent tried anything). Secured parking in front of the hotel. ",

We camped within the compound and had sundowners and cooked dinner right on the edge of the cliff and watched the fisherman’s lights come on as it got dark.  A magical sight. It would be great for big rigs and roof tents. It’s much cheaper and has a better view of the lake than the fancy expensive lodge up the road. Didas who is the caretaker looked after us well and can arrange for you to camp on the cliff edge. We really enjoyed being here and it is absolutely worth the trip just to see the fishermen at night.  We paid $15 for both of us including a tip for the lady who washed our dishes. Bonus! There is also wildlife around, gazelles, colobus monkeys and donkeys as well as goats. ",

Rooms are a bit expensive and not necessarily up to European standards but they are still comfortable. Everything is sparking clean and staff will make everything for you to feel good. Above all, this is run by and for the community. Indeed, farmers around struggle with elephants and Buffalos of the park which are coming to eat in their fields. Also sometimes you hear the drums in the evening, farmers trying to scare elephants. Elephants can also cross the site. ",

The campsite has its own forest and swamp which guests can walk around free of charge. A guide can be arranged too. It has 7 primate species that can be seen here in the forest and some frequent the camp. It is a cold shower but a hot shower can be arranged on request and ablutions were very clean. We also enjoyed a campfire at no extra cost. There is a bar but they are still working on implementing a restaurant. Local meals can be arranged through them from Bigodi village. The little details made the place for us such as the candles lit around the campsite at night and the stunning view. Currently, a self contained banda and treehouse in the forest are being built. The camp is developing in stages. There is a tap for running water. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will go as far as to say it was definitely one of the better campsites we have come across for a month in Uganda. ",

    "description": "This is the Bumaga campsite in Semuliki National Park about 2kms after the Sempaya Tourism Centre going towards Ntandi. The campsite is managed by the Uganda Wildlife Authority and set in a small forest clearing with a mound for the fireplace. Booking for hot spring, nature or bird walks in the park can be booked at the Sempaya Tourism Centre if paying with Visa or cash. You can also book at Bumaga but only cash. One can camp at the campsite for 20 000ush pp (at time of visit) and only pay park entrance fees and activity fees for the day the activity is done. We paid 35$ pp for park entrance and 30$pp for birding (UWA 2020 price list). \r\n\r\nMany C African bird species are found only here for E Africa as the park borders DRC. \r\n\r\nThe staff were friendly and helpful. Our birding guide was great and the hot springs were very impressive. \r\n\r\nCold shower. \r\nRunning water. \r\nThe toilets and showers are not right at the campsite but a short walk to the staff compound. Western toilet with flushing water and all clean. \r\nA fire was also included in the camping. \r\nSmall bar with sodas and beer.\r\nLocal food can be arrange with prior notice. \r\nCooking equipment can be hired according to the UWA write up of the campsite. We had our own equipment. \r\n\r\nAlso black and white Colobus, red Colobus, red-tails, grey cheeked mangabey and de Brazza's monkey. \r\n\r\n",

Turn left at the pangolin rescue camp site through a narrow dirt road through banana trees. Not suitable for large rigs but medium sized truck 7.6 metres x 3.2 high got in. If they have a pangolin on site you can enjoy a pangolin experience by joining them on a walk in the neighbouring forest and tea plantation when they take the pangolins out to eat. Also offering an interesting village walk of Rugando. Definately an amazing worthwhile experience whilst donating to the rescue of almost extinct pangolins. ",

We had the dinner buffet for 110Zk pp (9,50€) which was great value and sourced almost entirely from the farm, service was outstanding. Lunch was also good especially the meat pies. Many marabou storks along short walking path out back. Wifi at restaurant/bar and reception which was comparatively fast. Very nice Scottish manager came by every day for a chat and to give us information about things to do and see. Great place for children with large playground and loads of different farm animals. 120Zk pp (8,50€)",

But in addition you have to pay the park fees, whether you like it or not. $20 pppn, $5 pppn for camping and $15 per vehicle. \r\nAblutions are nice (hot water, open air sgower) and a campfire is provided, though in our case way too late, so we made it our selves. No wifi or even cell phone reception. Campsite bar is not operational. Even though you are in the middle of a wildlife park and you are right next to the river there is no guard. Staff is okay. Campsites are mediocre. No braais or kitchen facilities. Very few standpipes which provide horribly dirty water. There are shelters but no tables or chairs. Flat spots are available, but most don't offer river views and those that do are so close to the water that we saw crocodiles chasing each other right next to the shelter! No electricity or lamps whatsoever. Campsite is not well maintained, except for the ablutions. ",

Established only 1.5 years ago by friendly but quite deceitful and amateuristic British owners who live here. Note: not reachable by road during wet season! We arrived just after, and one stretch of track was so muddy that we got stuck and had to be pulled out. The last 5 km was generally very bad track and their repairs after the end of wet season made things even worse. But the setting and views are absolutely amazing. They don't have a campsite but if a chalet is free than you might be permitted to use the bathroom and camp right next to the chalet. It may be wise to phone ahead. Ruth (0973376432). We paid $10 pppn but this may be higher in high season. Note that if a chalet is rented out during your stay, then you have to leave! They lied to us about this which came to light when we were forced to turn around because we got stuck again when trying to leave. \nCountless birds are to be spotted here and hippos and crocs roam in the water nearby. We had a hippo walking right next to the car one night. We almost felt we were bushcamping because of no boats, cars or people going by. Not even staff. Bathrooms in the chalets are very clean and offer beautiful views over the river. Showers are lukewarm at best. Dinner is $20 (3 course) and quite good but not worth the money. Bar/restaurant is a bit empty but has an amazing setting. Firewood is provided if you ask. No tsetse flies, though there are quite a few on the road to the lodge.\nSince its not a campsite there is no kitchen, braai or electricity outlet, but you can start your campfire anywhere you like and one chalet has a small shelter nearby.

We filled in the immigration forms while he was gone and then on his return he stamped us in. For the Carnet we had to go to another building, but it was completely locked. The immigration guy came out and then went somewhere to try and find the guy. We waited at least half an hour for the guy to show up and then sat in his office for what felt like an hour for him to type all the vehicles details into the system with one finger. We had to pay $25, which they prefer by card, presumably in an attempt to curb corruption. The machine however didn’t work so we gave him shillings, but then he had to transfer the money from his M-Pesa account to get a receipt number to enter into the system. This also failed to work so in the end he just wrote a note. Immigration gave us two months, but the customs officer only gave the vehicle 1 month in Tanzania.

We waited for 3 nights for the boat to arrive but couldn't get any information until it was alongside.

Motorbikes were $50 and a Hilux was $300 for transit alone, we then needed to add loading costs which were $30 for bikes and $200 for the Hilux. Local on the wharf told us that it should be less and that $40 for foreigners sounded right, even the crane manager said it should be much less at least for the cabin but no movement for the operators, we spoke to the captain but were just referred to the clerk for sales.\n\nThe boat itself wasn't great but expected from a 100 year old boat, toilets stunk and 1st class did not have private bathroom as posted everywhere online, just a private section for 1st class passengers. \n\nWe decided it was too expensive and so did not do the journey opting instead to take the road  Shame\n\nThey were going to allow us to keep our dogs in the 1st class cabin.",

    "description": "Mark Harvey, who owns Kapishya Hot Springs, runs Buffalo Camp in North Luangwa National Park as well. He's a very knowledgeable guide and leads excellent walking tours there. Usually people stay in rustic chalets at $100 pppn, but when the chalets are full, they may allow you to camp for $40 pppn. The entire camp, including the camping area, is on the Mwaleshi Riverbank, which has water year round. Campers have a hot shower, flush toilet, and sink. The team at Kapishya told us about this option when we were there, and we were very happy we went. The walks are $25 pp, which is excellent value, considering how much you see and learn. The walks last about 4 hours each. Evening walks are followed by sundowners (Beware very high prices for the drinks), and then a night drive back to camp. You can self cater. One must pay park fees on top of this: $20 per person plus $15 for a vehicle plus $30 pppn bed levy. That's $115 per night in the park for two adults. (We paid 1060 kwacha at their exchange rate). Open mid June to end October. Email: kapishya@shiwasafaris.com",

We got stamps in the passports and were asked to pay something. We payed 10 USD each \"la motivation\" (initially wanted 20 USD each).\r\n- There seems to bei no official customs office, actually there are not many foreign cars crossing so we explained the lady at the barrier how to handle the cdp. There was no stamp available...\"because of sunday\".\r\n- At the same entry we got a ticket for the parking fee. We payed inside at the caisser and got a recipe. Each motorbike 25 USD ( for a small vehicle, there are no prices for motorbikes, truck ist 200, abnormal load is 300)\r\n- We had to pay another 25 USD per motorbike \"Trafigo\" they also call it \"entry fee\" it ist like a road tax and valid for one month.\r\n- Back at the barrier there were two police officers in civil clothes and they wanted to do a security check. They had no ID card and in the beginning we refused (because of all the guys around the border telling you anything). After they convinced us that they are \"real\" the check took a little bit longer. But no complains, not asking for \"la motivation\".\r\n- After that and with all the papers we could pass the first barrier and we left the compound.\r\n\r\nThe whole boarder procedure took us 3.5 hours and costed 85 USD per bike.\r\nMore or less just an African boarder crossing. Could have been faster if we had more information in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Natural, quiet and peaceful, this establishment is stunning and also has safe, accessible and good walking trails around the farm. Not too far from Mbala and Lake Tanganyika, this lovely spot is ideal for visiting and exploring the surrounding areas without the busyness of the towns, and us also an ideal place for some downtime, time to recoup and 'to get away from it all'. Accessibility is via an approximately 3 km dirt track from the D1 road to the cottage and campsite, easily traversed with 2x4 vehicle even in rainy season. The price is US$ 50 for the cottage per night including hot shower and running  toilet with wood provided for the donkey boiler or US$ 10 pppn camping with an available hot shower and toilet. The cottage is serviced daily and includes cutlery, crockery, towels, mosquito net, microwave, gas oven and plates, fridge and its own bathroom with hot shower via donkey boiler and everything one needs for a comfortable stay. Drinking water is from a spring, boiling optional. No Wi-Fi, but there is local network available. Limited, but sufficient flat ground is available for rooftop vehicles. Hosts Jackie and Kevin are wonderfully hospitable who will make you feel welcome, at home and well looked after, as well as provide good knowledge of the area and what to see and visit if needing anything. Highly recommend this place and all it offers - a must stay if passing this side of the country from one night or more. It's hard to leave once here!

It is easily accessible by good tar roads. 20 mins from the Great East/Airport roundabout, 15 mins from the Great North Road. It is 20 mins from town/shops and \r\n5 mins from Bonanza Golf club (restaurant). It is 15 mins from Lusaka Airport.\r\n\r\nAccommodation is a choice of a thatched Rondavel with Kingsize bed and bathroom or camping with the use of the Rondavel bathroom. There is a lot of space to park a vehicle with a rooftop tent. The whole property is secured by an electric fence with electric gate. This is a great place to spend a peaceful night away from the noise of the city and among fabulous bird life and a small herd of Angoni cattle. Camping is $10 pppn and the cottage $40 pn.

Created by a French vet, Victoire, this camp offers bungalows and some camping places. Drinking water from a borehole. Solar electricity in the commune.\r\nDry toilet. Outdoor shower, hot water on request.\r\nThe camp is a farm with pigs, goats, chickens, dogs and cats. An enchantment for the children. Shady pitches.\r\nVictoire will propose you various activities to discover the surrounding communities. Possibility to accompany her during her veterinary visits. She can organise a visit to a fishing village with a local guide, a visit to the elephant orphanage in the Kafue Park, a boat cruise on the Kafue Lake at sunset...\r\nWe loved this place so much with Victoire's warm and caring welcome that we went back before we left Zambia. The communities have stayed away from tourism. They love to be photographed without any financial compensation. The children do not ask for anything. Do not offer them a pen, candy or money. We have contributed to the life of the village by making the seamstress work, by hiring a local guide...\r\nThe camp is closed during the rainy season\r\nContact Victoire Delesalle by WhatsApp: 00 260 977 33 61 42\r\nassomelindika@gmail.com\r\nhttp://melindika.org",

There's solar power at camping spots (they turn the generator on until 21, but is not too loud) and great place to wash the dishes. There are many barbecue grills. You can storage some food at their fridge to be safe of some hungry elephant at night. The bar and restaurant area is really comfortable with few sofas to relax. There's a very small pool but if you go during the week theres a good chance that the main house is not booked so you can use the amazing pool.

Calm and green place.\r\n\r\nIt offers private chalets (50usd two people), shared 4bed dorms w/ private bathroom (15usd pbed) and campsites (10usd pp). Accommodation is simple, but very clean and cosy. And a big breakfast is included!  \r\n\r\nDefinitely the best of this place is that its situated right in the bush. And as its neighboring the Zambezi National Park, wildlife roams freely around the place (you might not see them, but you ll see its tracks!).\r\n\r\nThe staff here is super friendly and they have very knowledgeable guides. They offer activities (as Bush Walk) much cheaper than what we found in Vic Falls (25usd). We strongly recommend doing the “Sleep with the herders” activity (we spent a night with the herders at their nomad camp, keeping lions away from the cows, pretty exciting!!)\r\n\r\nWe came here for a couple of days and ended up staying for a month doing some volunteer work. We were caught up by the amazing work they do in regenerating the land. \r\n\r\nThey haven’t had much tourists lately, but now theres a new manager working hard on making the place shine again!  \r\n\r\n\r\nPs: signs on the road arent very clear. Coming from Vic Falls 4km after passing the airport entrance you ll see a sign “Dimbangombe Safaris” turn right. Go 7.5km following the signs for “Africa Centre for Hollistic Management (ACHM) or “Reception”. ",

It's a beautiful spot, on a flat patch of sand. It's an elephant highway, the riverbed, calm elephants going up and down. Also many relaxed baboons (wild, they leave you alone) and saw Black backed jackal and Spotted hyena drinking at night. We heard lions further south but didn't see them.\r\n\r\nWe actually booked Chitake 2 but that's a farce of a campsite, in the middle of shrub, overgrown, no view anywhere around, and we were hoping to see the lions at that spot as everyone keeps saying it is dangerous lion territory up there, but did not even see tracks, so we went for the much more beautiful Chitake 1 instead. Amazingly quiet at night except for nature sounds.\r\n\r\nBring everything yourself as if wild camping. There is only a pit toilet. ",
