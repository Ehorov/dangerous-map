Detention can be lengthy, damaging to health and welfare, and of uncertain outcome. You should avoid any activity which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence.

These groups hold strong anti-western views which could make any British interest or person a target. Daesh Khorasan Province (ISKP) continues to be a serious threat and is fiercely hostile to the UK, other western countries and some religious minority communities. Daesh and other groups also target NGOs and humanitarian organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to travel to Afghanistan against \u003cabbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth \u0026amp; Development Office\"\u003eFCDO\u003c/abbr\u003e advice, you should be aware terrorists have a strong desire to target public places frequented by foreigners. Following the death of Al Qaida leader, Ayman al- Zawahiri, in a US drone attack, British Nationals should be aware that the situation may be volatile. If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan you should be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions. An attack on Kabul International Airport on 26 August 2021 killed at least 183 people. Further attacks against aviation and/or airports are very likely. In trying to target foreigners, restaurants and hotels (such as the Serena in Kabul) could be targeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eISKP have claimed attacks against the Taliban in a variety of locations such as hospitals, military and security establishments. Historically, government ministries (official buildings and agencies such as passport offices) have been targeted. Diplomatic premises may be attacked to undermine Taliban claims of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is likely that terrorists will continue with their tactic of planning attacks at busy and congested times of day, potentially coinciding with local or religious festivals. In the past this has included attacks against schools, market places, religious minorities - including targeting Shia sites, communities and districts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAttacks in Afghanistan include roadside and suicide bombs either on foot or by vehicle, indirect rocket and mortar fire, direct fire (including shootings and rocket propelled grenades) as well as kidnappings and violent crime. Further attacks are very likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are in Afghanistan, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly. Keep others, including family and friends, informed of your travel plans. You are strongly encouraged to avoid setting regular patterns of travel and behaviour making yourself the target of an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/\"\u003eUK Counter Terrorism Policing\u003c/a\u003e has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 100 westerners were  kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001; a number of them have been British nationals.  Some foreign nationals remain in captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. If you chose to go to Afghanistan against \u003cabbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth \u0026amp; Development Office\"\u003eFCDO\u003c/abbr\u003e advice, you should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n",
