There are multiple sights: the labs, the factories, the city - for family of the researchers - and 2 airfields. Lots of buildings, flats, garages and even a football field etc are (semi)-intact and you’ll find multiple tanks and vehicles lying around. The US government cleaned the island in the ‘00’s, so is should be safe. We spend an entire afternoon on the island and met some looters that were looking for metal, so slowly they’re tearing and burning everything apart.\r\n\r\nStrangely there’s a good gravel road from Moynaq all the way to the island - we drove 80kmph on average. After\r\nthe road ends, follow the dirt road for 15kms. It’s on maps.me: take the west road from Moynaq and not the east road!

The weather has been very hot this weekend so thousands of families travelling crammed into every form of transport have been out driving to have picnics and pick flowers. The road up to this spot was heaving, but most left as it was going dark. Visited by the police who were just being inquisitive and very friendly. You cannot access the petroglyps via this road as an army camp is in the way.  The road ends in a carpark outside the gates to it.\r\nThe police said we had to go back down the road a bit, to where the red warning sign is on the I-Overlander map and drive around to that way. We will do this tomorrow. Visited by a family barbecuing nearby with a kebab of meat pieces for each of us.  I would guess that normally this place will be virtually deserted normally.",
