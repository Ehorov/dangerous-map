Big rigs are probably a no-go, but I had no problem going up slowly in my 2WD sedan. A lot of the area is a soft dirt, so be super careful, and watch the weather. It rained hard for me in the morning so I moved out of the dirt onto the gravel. I saw a tick or two in the forested parts, and a few spiders in the dirt. Otherwise bugs weren’t too bad, especially compared to the other site nearby (Brandywine track).\r\n\r\nI know I’ve only written about the negatives so far but it’s a really nice, huge couple of spots, pretty quiet. 2 bars + LTE on T-Mobile. No promises it’ll be this empty in the future, there was some farm equipment sitting by the road but it seemed untouched for quite a while",

Nice gravel road, only site available on this road. Quiet. Ranger comes through once in while and an occasional local. Site is right along the road. There is no spot for a tent. The site is unattended and is just filled with raspberry, strawberry, huckleberry, fern etc. Where there is grass it is blended and on a slope. Where it is flatter becomes a mud puddle when it rains. Once temps hit 75 the black flies, flies, mosquito, etc are more than abundant. So much that day hikers have decided not to return until cooler. The site is in full sun  They mention a stream, it across the road and another down the road, each apx 125' into the woods/down the road but it is no more than ankle deep, sometimes running underground. I have seen a unique bird, one rabbit, one deer, one box turtle and appears there is a bear.\r\nThere is highway and plane noise but both quiet enough.\r\nMy Cricket phone usually works. Don't always have access for more than text/call. Usually a reboot helps.\r\nAfter 6 quiet days we headed out due to temps and bugs. The site has 2 pieces of toilet paper so pretty good. No water, garbage or tables. Has a makeshift fire ring. Wood can be tough to find as locals get it. I will give this spot 2 stars and won't use it again.",

Easy road that an average car or rig could manage but trails very very close to the water so if you are wide or came after a big rain the road could be effected. This camp spot is as far as you can go before crossing the river. At the time we were here it was just over knee deep and we didn’t feel like risking it even in our high clearance vehicle but the road does continue further. However the spot right at the crossing is amazing, it sits between two rivers/creeks so you have water flowing on all three sides of you, there is a beaver dam that separates the two and if you’re lucky you’ll spot the little guys running around. There is a nice sized pre existing fire ring and just enough bush coverage for some shade.  No reception for AT\u0026T or Verizon ",

    "description": "The parking lot of St. Margaret Mary’s Church is right off of 61st and Dodge St., across from the University Nebraska at Omahas campus. There are UNO local police and UNO security driving in the area but not through the church parking lot.\r\n\r\nSafety: I’ve stayed here a few nights and have not been woken up by police or security. I have left around 10am each time and the parking lot is not busy. I am unsure if the church is 24 hrs and if the door is open in the evening for access to the bathroom. However, there are two close by gas stations within a mile or so. The parking lot is lit however if you prefer a darker sleeping area, closer to the end of the parking lot near the trees provides a less lit area. There is not broken glass on the ground in the parking lot (unlike Zorinsky Lake) so break ins do not seem frequent. \r\n\r\nScenery: Elmwood Park and Memorial Park are within walking distance which is a relaxing area to walk pets or hammock. There is a line of trees that separate the parking lot from Dodge St. so the noise of traffic is not unbearable. \r\n\r\nFood: Being right on Dodge St. accessibility to food is easy and a variety is all within a mile (pizza, ramen, Mediterranean, curry, Chinese, fast food).

The hike is easy and follows the road and then the creek floodplain for approximately 2.2 km or 1.25 miles to the ice cave. Easy flat hike, but quite pretty along Castner Creek. May be more challenging depending on peak water flows. The ice cave is amazing although you can’t go into it since the creek rages out of the cave mouth. Wish I had my phone to take photos.

There are 5 camping spaces on gravel that include picnic benches with sun coverings and electric hookups and there are a few camping spaces in a grassier area as well with hookups, picnic tables and fire pits. There are two potable water spigots by the campsite but more around. Dumpster on site, bathrooms that are open 24/7 with one shower in each near a dump site. Super gorgeous area, right next to a playground and a lake with beautiful flowers and sweet ducklings. There’s also a lovely cemetery past the lake from the 1800s. Donations of $15 a night are appreciated but not required. Sheriff was nice. Would defiantly stay again. ",

Fishermen started coming in the morning but didn't come near where we were. The river was super clear and the kids loved swimming in it. There's also an established campsite down the road (instead of going down the boat ramp) but they wanted $30 for non-electric and $40 for electric cash only. There were no river views from that campground. The place we found was absolutely amazing! We cleaned all the trash that we found, please keep it that way!

Excellent Verizon service (no AT\u0026T). \r\n\r\nThere are many small pullouts along this mountain road with little to no traffic. This is the first larger pullout we found, big enough for a couple smaller rigs or one large-ish rig (there’s also a fire pit). Right beside the creek but a bit of a climb down from this spot. A little farther up the road (~100 m) there is a very large paved pullout (big enough for any rig) with a path down to the creek. \r\n\r\nThe left side of the road is at the base of the mountain, so watch for fallen rocks and trees. Do NOT park on the left side of the road. For a short time the road parallels hwy 101, but there’s a hill and trees blocking, so there’s minimal road noise. The road is paved in good condition (at least for the first couple miles). There were some tree branches on the road but easy to drive around. Expect the possibility of freshly fallen trees after heavy rains. We stopped at the first good site we found and walked up about a mile or so. There are likely more pullouts further up the road. \r\n\r\nThis is a great spot for a night or two, with close proximity to the Redwoods and the Oregon border. Though it’s next to a road, it is beautiful, quiet and peaceful. We we’re here in the summer after a few days of rainfall so there were mosquitoes. It’s not the worst we’ve experienced, but bring some means of deterrent or you’ll wish you had. ",

A 3-load warm water wash was $4.75. Cost varies depending on size of machine and water temperature selected. Cheapest option is $3.50 for a 2-load cold water wash. There are two sizes of dryers, which I would call large and XL. Cost of the smaller (large) dryers is $0.25 for 8 minutes. ",

I did make it to the NF55-Ext to turn around with a 10' truck camper, but I definitely was hitting some smaller branches. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend any trailers as turning around would be impossible until you got to the NF55-Ext turnoff. \r\n\r\nThere is no cell here and Starlink would have obstructions because you have tall ledges and trees to your north.",

This spot although has no immediate lake views is larger and could fit two small vehicles or tent even with privacy. You can walk a short distance for a nice view too. Nothing large should attempt this as there is only small opportunities for turn arounds. Great spot for the night and close to the flathead valley. Decent reception for both AT\u0026T and Verizon ",

An official may stop and check you out but he has to give you 72 hours to move and has at least 24 hours to obtain a move ticket for your windshield, not a fine, so you have plenty of time to stay.  The man says if a local complains, let him.  He said that parking in front of sleeping facilities like motels, and apartment complexes, is discouraged. \r\n\r\nWhere is camping allowed? Parking lots people may sleep overnight in a vehicle, camper, trailer, tent, or Conestoga hut in a parking lot of a religious organization, business, or public entity as long as there is an occupied structure on site.\r\n\r\nRest stops- You are permitted to sleep overnight in your vehicle while at an Oregon Rest Area. You just cannot stay beyond 12 hours. It's worth noting that you must be inside your vehicle while sleeping overnight. This is because sleeping outside, either on the ground or on a bench could be construed as camping. \r\n\r\nPlease research and be sure. You are welcome.",

Come visit Bruce and his airplane home! He is SO inviting, and told me to post this and let you all know you’re welcome to visit and stay here for free, IF YOU READ THE WEBSITE FIRST FOR HIS VISITOR REQUIREMENTS. You must visit AirplaneHome.com and read through it first, and be respectful of his wishes and home. Some notes:\n\n-Steep and narrow-ish driveway but anything smaller than 20ft should have no issue getting up here. You CANNOT park on the road, you must come up the driveway- walk it first if need be. He said biggest rig was a 30 something ft skoolie, but they did have a couple dings from the trees as they tried to maneuver through his property to park somewhere. I’d recommend keeping it under 20ft. My 2WD very low clearance rig made it just fine.\n-You may visit during the day or also park overnight on his property, as well as use his hookups and his plane lavatory/bathroom as needed. Permission not required. (I still emailed him to let him know) I had between 2-3 bars 5GE with AT\u0026T.\n-You can fly your drone (just not above the tree line in respect to his neighbors) and take any photos/videos you want. You can also climb on the right wing, the top/fuselage, and check out the inside. Very strict on keeping feet clean and no shoes inside or on the stairs.\n-He loves to share about his process and philosophies, and is always open to talking. If you speak Japanese he will absolutely love you. \n-Most of the ground is not flat, but I recommend keeping your stay to 1 or 2 nights, and not overextending our welcome here. \n-Dogs are fine and welcome to be off leash AND explore on the wing of the plane if you trust your pup to be safe. There are walnut trees out here, which are highly toxic to dogs via chewing sticks or the nuts, so be diligent. He hasn’t had any issues but I’m paranoid about that stuff. The majority of trees are not walnut but still, just a note\n\n*The inside of the plane is not built out, but it is gutted with a partial build and amazing nonetheless. He LOVES dogs, and will gladly play with your pup and talk your ear off if you’re up for conversation.",

I was the only one to stay so hopefully this is legal. :’) keep it clean, this place was a gem! Happy camping! :-)",

Straight Lake State Park is to the South and Straight Lake Wildlife Area is basically surrounding the lot to the East and North Another small lot for Ice Age trail to the west a few hundred feet. THAT lot IS signed as a Trailhead and Fee Area. There's power lines overhead and room for most small to medium sized rigs. The lot is clearly an established lightly used slightly overgrown parking area with large boulders surrounding it. About ½ of it is mostly blocked from view of the road, rather secluded. This technically should be the Straight Lake WI State Park. There's only the one sign, a reasonable person would conclude parking here is ok, but vehicles not allowed beyond the area.\r\n\r\nLots of the Ice Age Trails have a Trailhead with no hrs or prohibiting signage\r\n\r\nAT\u0026T service is ok,  not great but usable, service is better closer to Luck and Frederic, gets worse to East and Northeast. A WeBoost gets you much better signal\r\n\r\nDirections: from Hwy 48 Turn North on 140th then Right on 280th and it runs right to it. \r\n\r\nThe Coon Lake Park in Frederic about 5 mi Northwest on Hwy 35 is a nice place to spend the day 6am to 10pm, there's a swimming area with small fountain, water on Lake side of flushing toilets. There's 120v and 4 prong 240v power on a pole at corner of parking lot near shelters. The shelters also have power.\r\n\r\nIn Frederic, there's a Dollar General, Holiday gas station with Subway and a hardware store. If you want a really good huge burger, head about 8.4mi North on hwy 35 to Lewis, WI the Sundown Saloon and Campground. About ½ lb burgers and delicious. They are CASH ONLY but do have an ATM in there.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Street parking in Mission District of SF. I slept on this street and it was relatively quiet and chill. Area is flat. \r\n\r\nYou can find parking on various small side streets in this vicinity, many of which are flat/level. (On the bigger streets too, but they’ll be more noisy).\r\n\r\nParking restrictions: in general, streets around here are 2 hr parking from 8am—9pm (sometimes only till 6 or 8pm, maybe) on weekdays, and no limit on weekends. There is also street cleaning which varies street to street, so make sure to look out for signs. Streets that directly border Dolores park have overnight restrictions based on height/length of vehicle. \r\n\r\nAvailability of spaces: If coming on a weekend or at night, you can have luck finding a parking spot around here. During the day on a weekday it will be tough.\r\n\r\nSafety: can’t guarantee this is the safest neighborhood for your car, but it is at least relatively safe. The Mission is quite gentrified, to say the least, and there are expensive cars parked all over. Nevertheless, there are signs at nearby Dolores Park instructing you not to leave valuables in the car.\r\n\r\nBathrooms: Dolores Park has 2 sets of bathrooms, one on either end (near 18th st and 20th st, respectively).\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself a parking spot in this neighborhood: get a burrito at Taqueria Cancun or El Farrolito (might be some of the best you’ll east in CA/the USA), have ice cream at Bi-Rite, buy pastries and bread from Tartine (the line moves quick), eat Burmese noodles at Yamo. These are all $15 or less excursions - if you want to spend some money on a special meal, do a little internet research, as you’re in a neighborhood where it will be worth it to do so. Also, mill about Dog Eared Books (used and new). And hang out in Dolores Park in the early eve, where you can feel a little bit of the kookoo wacko energy that once defined SF and is perhaps still holding on by at a thread. ",

Turnpike traffic isn’t too loud and kind of tranquil. The campground is surrounded by trees and next to a tiny river, the area itself also has something for history buffs. Bathrooms gave me some Silent Hills vibes at night but the showers worked great. Spots have either power/water hookups or power/water/sewage, there’s also a dump site and dumpster on the campgrounds. A couple of the attached photos contains more information on the campgrounds taken from the Passport America app. The campgrounds is big rig friendly, just realized I clicked the wrong entry.",

North of the lot is gated off to vehicles. Approx 0.75 mi Northwest or Northeast to the River.\r\nDirections: Off Hwy 12 Take Oak Knoll Rd North then at T with Pine Rd take Left or West then take first R or North onto Riverview Rd. At end of pavement, continue straight or North to sand/dirt rd to lot. \r\n\r\nThe place is fairly secluded but locals use it to hike and dog walk. The lot is rather small and there is not a lot of room to turn around. It's only 0.3 mi off the pavement so walk it first if you're not sure. End of paved road area there are  'No Parking' signs on both sides. The dirt road is a bit narrow with a couple dips. One spot is soft loose sand near paved road end. With a little running start, any vehicle should get through no problem.  It's short. Otherwise, path is hard-packed sand.\r\nThe lot is small and I wouldn't suggest anything larger than a long van etc. And for a trailer more than maybe 14ft is gonna be tight to turn around \r\nAT\u0026T phone internet is a little slow but usable here. Other service may work better.\r\nThere seems to be lots of Public land near the river.\r\n",

Possibly a good backpacking spot to park.\r\n\r\nNote that this is on a 1 lane road that doesnt always have passing areas for on-coming traffic and has many blind hairpin turns. The gravel road is steep, along a big cliff, and has some hidden potholes in areas, but drove up it in a low clearance vehicle with only a few bumps. Driving between 10-20mph takes about 35 minutes to drive to this spot from the damn entrance.\r\n\r\nBarely can hear the highway in the forest at night, but treefrogs are quite active here starting around 9pm. Seen a small black bear, but it quickly ran away when it saw me. Keep food and trash packed away.\r\n\r\n",

We only stayed one night and arrived very late at 10:30 PM. Because this is a neighborhood we wanted to be respectful to the people around us, we left around 9 AM. I wouldn’t recommend staying more than a night or two! ",

It is first come first serve and check out is 4pm. At each site there is a fire ring and a picnic table. There is also a small little building with a mens and womens bathroom. Not sure about the mens side but the womens side has two toilets, one sink, and one shower. Nothing beautiful but it works and there is hot water. On the west side of the small white building next to where you deposit your money there is a fresh water spigot where you can fill up your tank. There is also a little free library, a playground, and a shelter. Plus before you go down the hill towards the campground/ on the north side of the gravel road there are really nice walking paths that go towards the lake greenfield rec area. There is also a dumpster but it was fairly full when I got here. The other thing to beware of is the raccoons at night, don’t leave anything out you don’t want taken. The one main down side is I did not have service in the campground but if I went up the gravel road you come in on at the top of that hill I got service. ",

Google might take you to where the hwy stops in line with this spot, but drive a little further down to find the forest road. It starts off paved then gravel/dirt, then some pavement again.\nThis particular spot is the first spot on the left right along the river. There is a semi-steep path down to the river behind the site. To Note: This is probably the only path in the area so other people will want to walk through the site to get to it. There is one more spot to the right and one U shaped spot that looks overgrown on the right as you turn right into this section. \nThis site is on the smaller side and a fire pit was made pretty much in the middle front area of the site. It may be better for an SUV/Car camping or a truck camper. However, depending on how tight you want to be two cars or an SUV and a car could maneuver themselves. There wasn't much of \"living\" area unless your vehicle is closer to the front of the site (for space behind them) or backed in far enough so that you use the space near the fire pit.\nThe river seems shallow but there is a deeper part. I was able to find some large rocks to hang onto and let my body float.\nTrain does go by in the early AM. I don't know what time they started but I heard 3 before 6AM, then there were more throughout the day. Some road noise while your awake but nothing that would disturb you. \nI had 2-3 bars of ATT\nI enjoyed my stay. You can see others pinned spots on the other side of the bridge. would love to check them out some time. enjoy!",

    "description": "There are a handful of parking lots with green circle signs that have free parking in the Atlantic ‘business district.’ If you drive around the area north of hwy 6 you will see a couple of them. The only rule is that you don’t stay longer than 24 hours. So I picked this parking lot because the City park is just a couple blocks from here and has a public restroom \u0026 water fountain that I believe is open 24/7. Well at least it was open past 9pm yesterday. Also the public library is a block away which is great for wifi and charging things. This parking lot is right next to a busy road, Poplar St, that can be loud in the early morning so if that won’t work for you I would pick one of the parking lots where it is on a less busy street. This location is perfect for car camping or camper vans basically anything that can fit into one spot and be semi incognito. ",

    "description": "Small campground on the Missouri River with several pads with electrical hookups, as well as many non-pad sites without electricity. Almost all the trees have been cut down offering very little shade. There is a strong, unidentified bad smell that does not go away no matter which way the wind blows. A motor vehicle permit is required as well as the camping fee. Dogs must be on a 6 ft. leash. Pit toilets. Boat ramps and dock. One bar Verizon signal. Camping limited to 14 days in a 30 day period. This park used to be larger with a camp host and a modern shower house with toilets (as mentioned on the website). Now there are none. Some locals told me the campground was flooded and that is why everything was torn down, including the trees.\n\nCurrent prices as of August 2022:\nDaily Non-Nebraska Vehicle $12 per day\nDaily Nebraska Vehicle $6 per day\nBasic camping $15 per night\nElectric hookup $25 per night",

It will be your very first left after passing Subway Cave Campgrounds, fire prevention sign before bridge. Go over bridge, until end of road then look left, and follow dirt road up hill.  First part is the roughest then the road becomes good.   Bigger R’V’s should be able to make it, my friends 18’ made it, just go slow, walk road if not comfortable.  Road goes back about 1 mile then loops in a circle back around.  Better camp spots further in.  Foot bridge about midway point just follow creek trail till you see it. 14 days free camping next to Hat Creek, and main campgrounds are over foot bridge for bathrooms, water available, and garbage cans.  Rim Rock store, and Chevron are 1/2 mile down to the right in Old Station.  Campfire permits can be obtained at small ranger center before hitting the Chevron store.  Trout planted every other week or so, great fishing.  Subway Cave, a Lava tube is right across Cave Campgrounds, bring flashlight, goes back about a block or so.  Burney Falls are also about 15-20 miles away.  4.5 Star dispersed camping, one of my all time faves.  Cell signal super spotty 1 bar LTE AT\u0026T.  (Cell Booster probably help). Signal Disappears for few sometimes, not always. Then it’s a waiting game, but it will work.  If you want a descent cell signal the concrete bridge area (walk around here) where you came in at is the best I’ve found.  Picked up 5G 1 bar.",

Stay to the right and pass a small bridge and you’ll be back on BLM land in about 5 miles. \r\n\r\nThe free camping is down v 8/10 rd but down this road only for about 1/2 mile. After that point there is NO camping. The road turns into paid/ reservation camping. \r\n\r\nIf you go towards this pin and follow the power lines there are a few pull-offs. \r\n\r\nJust about any car can get to the pin. IF you pass the pin and head further south the road gets worse. I completed it in a Truck in 2WD the whole time so not a hard road but you WILL NEED clearance. No cars.

Bigger rigs and trailers would not fit in the parking spaces and I think RVs would probably stand out too much. I felt lucky to find a good quiet spot. I enjoyed a drink and there’s food restaurants nearby. I left a nice tip. I got takeout and brought it to the bar. \r\nAnd since they don’t serve food they suggested it. A real interesting place to see in Austin: it’s a building built around some real trains! I walked my small quiet dog on a leash around the area but he was not allowed inside.",
