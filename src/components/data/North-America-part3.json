They have landscaped everything beautifully - stunning nature all around. 200MX per person incl camping, which we thought was a lot at first until we saw the cenotes and we were the only ones there. Dog was free snd she had so much space to run around. Worth every peso - we gave them an extra 100 tip. One cenote is underground and well lit, great to see in the evenings, the other is naturally lit from 10am and is approx 10 mins walking from the campsite - the owner walks you there and you can stay as long as you like totally alone. Amazing experience.\r\n\r\nWe arrived just after 5pm which was perfect - cant check in much after 6pm. Do not follow Google maps, unless on moto or small car as branches are too low for big rigs. Instead, take the long road and there is much better clearance for taller rigs - takes longer but way less stressful! When heading towards Homun from Cuzama on the 10, turn right at these coords: 20.741165,-89.307939 then follow on Maps until you reach Mani Chan.\r\n\r\nClean basic toilets and showers. They light campfires in the evening. Small tienda with basic snacks.

Which contradicts the common wisdom shared with us before our trip to Mexico “there is no USLD south of the border.” \r\n\r\nOur advice if you’re bringing a modern diesel vehicle (bring some def and keep an eye out for more at the myriad autozones for when you run out) - map out Mobil stations and call ahead to make sure they have UBA on hand.

The price for the location was great to visit the fancy resort areas of tulum without the Bouigee price! 🙏🏽 just ask when you turn in for parking and they charge per day. Smaller vehicles can negotiate more, maybe $2-300MXN ",

There is a side road with easy access and relatively flat camping for several vehicles, a toilet room with a flush bucket, and a patio with table, chairs \u0026 electrical outlet we used to heat up water for coffee.  There is even a sweat lodge frame by the river, and a rope swing to jump in it!\r\n\r\nThe family is super friendly and the mom is an amazing cook - refreshing beverages and huge, delicious meals at great prices.  Camping is 30pesos per person and includes use of facilities incl the river.  Locals come for the day to swim and picnic. We were the only campers at this time. \r\n\r\nThere are hot springs very close for 10 pesos and 50 pesos. We soaked at the 10 pesos one because the more famous 50 pesos hot spring didn't allow dogs. \r\n\r\nSmall biting bugs come out at dusk and dawn. Using insect repellent or staying covered did the trick.\r\n\r\nThey have 1 German Shepard here which is pretty chill. The neighbors dogs do come over sometimes but they are friendly too.   The weekend was busier than midweek but it's pretty mellow here every day, not as crowded as the neighbors.  Highly recommend this special place and special hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There is also a possibility to stay overnight little further in the small road, aside the church. They told us we could choose. Very quiet, almost no vehicle passes here. A friendly lady knocked at our door, she was worried and asked if we had food, or if she could cook us a meal. Tip for big rigs: To reach this place, take the narrow unpaved side road to the right from the way out of the village, direction Puno. Don’t try to reach it from the main square.",

We visited this small village in 2005 and were welcomed very warmly, visited the institute, the mayor and did an excursion together with the students. It was very interesting. \r\nNow we are in Peru again, we wanted to go there again and see the evolution. The village has grown a lot, people are still as friendly and welcoming, it’s still a traditional Altiplano village. They immediately organised for us a visit to the 2 different institutes they have now (pedagogic and technological), they organised meetings with the staff of both, who explained us about their institutions. We were invited by the mayor, and the day after at an event where students were involved, it was the last day of an environmental project that they did during 2 months of the holidays, planting trees in the whole region. It was an unforgettable experience.\r\nPeople of the village are not used to see visitors, but they are very interested to meet more foreign people. \r\nThe people of the institutions asked us to tell our friends and fellow travellers about their institutions. They like to invite them for a visit, they will be happy to have more international contacts. All visitors are very welcome, those who like to speak with students will be free to do so, even those who like teaching once or for a certain period will be very welcome. Accommodation can be organised.\r\nContact: Jenny (English teacher) jemazenteno@gmail.com \r\nor Wilmer (in Spanish) Wilmerr@gmail.com \r\nThe mayor asked us to tell people about the village and the region. He wants to share the local culture with all visitors who are interested. \r\nBesides our visit to Ichuña, we also enjoyed a lot the very scenic road on the Altiplano. Although it was a very rough road, we will certainly pass there again, on our way up north. \r\n",

Note the free showers at the Pemex a couple of kms away!\r\n\r\nToilets in the Soriana during opening hours.\r\n\r\nFree WiFi, average speed in the spot I was in.",

    "description": "If you can't bear the stifling heat and humidity of Tapachula, this is a literal breath of fresh air. Rustic campsite, popular with local people on weekends and holidays. $10 to park for the day, after some consideration they charged me $50 for the night. Flattish field with pine trees on one side, under which are benches and tables, BBQ grills and space for hammocks etc. Bucket flush toilets, a small restaurant and tiendita, they also rent a bunch of stuff, from hammocks to balls, at reasonable prices. It's on the slopes of the volcano with good views up on a clear day.\r\n\r\nI believe it's possible to hire a guide for the trek up from here if you wish - 7 or 8 hours to a campsite below the summit, an hour and a half or so to the crater from there, then back down - so a two-day trip total - they quoted $3000.. apparently possible to do without guide, ideally around December when there are lots of people hiking - but they warned me that the cost of a rescue is closer to $10,000!\r\n\r\nNot really set up for vehicles I think - the road is accessible but a little steep and rough towards the end - they asked me to move my van away from the trees once I was up, and park it over in the far corner.\r\n\r\nWhat sporadic phone reception there is, comes from the Guatemalan side, so unless you have an active Guatamala SIM it's not much use to you. Mexican signal in Union Juarez below. Check out the mirador in Cordoba, and if you want to stretch your legs there's a shortish but steepish hike through the jungle down to a small waterfall from there too. Pity the folk who commute to and from school and work from there daily!",

The weather is hot during the day but generally cool at night. The water is earth-colored and you can swim in few places. It is possible to embark and get to know the streams that are full of beautiful birds and you can see some crocodiles diving. The sunsets on the pier are exceptional. It is a paradise if you have the capacity for enjoyment. We slept with the doors of the Camper open next to the lagoon and nobody and nothing has bothered us for a week. The police came just to greet us and tell us local stories. I wish they could come and enjoy how simple and harmonious this place is. Perfect to relax. If you have a hammock, it can even be placed on top of the dock. Other travelers pitched tents under the roof of the pier and at the end of the road without being bothered by anyone. There is very short grass between the lagoon and the houses to walk with puppies or with the family. Honey, I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\r\n\r\nSu malecón y muelles son muy pintorescos. Es un pueblo muy pequeño. Algunas tardes hay marimba en vivo. Las personas son muy amigables y buscan conversar. El clima es caliente de día pero fresco de noche en general. El agua es color tierra y se nada en pocos lugares. Es posible embarcarse y conocer los arroyos que están plagados de bellas aves y se puede ver algunos cocodrilos sambullirse. Los atardeceres en el muelle son excepcionales. Es un paraíso si tienes la capacidad de disfrute. Dormimos con las puertas de la Camper abiertas al lado de la laguna y nadie ni nada nos ha incomodado en una semana. La policía llegó solo a saludarnos y contarnos anécdotas locales. Ojalá pudieran venir y disfrutar de lo simple y armonioso que este lugar. Perfecto para relajarse. Si tienes una hamaca, se puede colocar inclusive arriba del muelle. Otros viajeros armaron carpas bajo el techo del muelle y al final del camino sin que nadie los incomodara. Hay pasto muy corto entre la laguna y las casas para pasear con perritos o en familia.Cariños, ojalá lo disfruten cómo nosotros.",

Second: ask the people in the town how to get to the Italian restaurant Rancho Colibri (everyone know it here) its outside the town on a not paved road inside the forest. \r\nThird: at the Colobri restaurant asked about the Rancho Campanario and the house of Gadiel and Juana. they have there a card with Gadiel's phone but also they explain well how to get to the area of the Rancho Campanario, its about 2 kilometers from the restaurant. \r\nForth: when you get to the entrance of the Rancho Campanario,  they will ask you for 20 pesos per person for entrance to the area, we payed but than Gadiel told us that if we say we coming to his house we should not pay this fee. anyway at this entrance ask where is the house of Gadiel, they will help you get there, its not more than 3 kilometers down the forest. \r\n\r\nthe road is not easy, it is very recommended to do it with 4x4 but don't have to, we were here in the dry season and still from the restaurant to the Rancho and to Gadiel house there is some hard up/down hills specially on the way back when its uphill. \r\n\r\n",

Not sure it's doable when it's the rainy season.\r\nThe wildcamping space itself is super quiet, along the river, on sand. We made a fire and swom in the 70cm deep and warm water.

From there you can access the main street and than hitchhike.\r\n\r\nNote: you can basically wildcamp wherever you want along the river. Fishing and swimming friendly.",

It's a steep concrete slabs road which I would only recommend for vans or 4*4 campers (narrow turns). We drive a VW Crafter L2H2 (similar to a Sprinter van) and were fine. \r\n\r\nThe place itself is gorgeously set between pine trees. It has cabanas for different groups sizes, a field to pitch a tent and space for a about two or three vans. It's $100p.p.p.n. There's a little restaurant (which we didn't try), flush toilets and a shower. They're pet friendly too!\r\n\r\nIt's an ecotourism campground so profits go to the locals. You can do a few pretty cool hikes in this area, but only with a local guide (to a viewpoint, a cave and a sinkhole). It costs about $250-350p, for up to a group of 6, depending on the hike (between 3-6 hours).\r\n\r\nOh and no cell reception or wifi here, enjoy nature!",

    "description": "To get here requires some effort, but it's totally worth it and here's why. This nature campsite is a protected area for wild axolotls! There are a few trails on the camp ground that lead towards pools where this critically endangered species live.\r\n\r\nSo that's why you want to go here, now how to get here. You need to make a reservation or call/whatsapp/facebook chat ahead. The phone number is +52 4412768838. The name of the place is Campamento El Cedral. \r\n\r\nTo get there I only recommend small vans or 4*4s with a rooftop tent. We have a 3m high, 6m long van and could not make it there (too many low hanging branches). So, instead we hiked about 2km downhill with our tent. Don't ask Google Maps to bring you here because it fails miserably. Find the bus stop in Pinal where Calle Federal 120, meets Calle La Escondida. Follow Calle La Escondida downhill to where the pavement ends. Take the left dirt road, it does show on MapsMe not on Google Maps. Follow this road all the way down, you'll see an axolotl painted on a wall to mark the entrance.\r\n \r\nCosts are pretty steep but worth it to protect this area. We payed $200p per person per night and there are zero amenities here, not even water. The only water source is where the axolotls live and you can't touch it (rightly so!). There are sites with fire pits. Dogs are welcome for another $100 and need to be kept on leash near the pools. There is Telcel signal ranging from H+ to 4G.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get more info you can also visit the highly recommend Pinal Adventures outdoors sports company in town.",

Without telling you anything about the costs up front the agency then wants you to pay 80 US$ for this video, which is way too expensive for one or two videos of you! \r\nThere are no nice video cuts of the whole trip, like getting in the boat (the start), ride with the boat (which can be fun), the snorkeling itself and the lunch break close to the beach of Isla Mujeres. \r\nBut 80$ without getting a nice memories of the whole trip, just for sending a video from underwater, without any work of editing? NO WAY!\r\nThe worst about all of it is that the guide told us she would send us the video for a tip. So we tipped and left our email address. In the end we received an Email telling us to pay 80$ for the video. There is always a new scam to experience I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nI in general don't understand why they ask for tips. They make us pay twice. \r\n\r\nThe captains job is to bring us safely to the destination and back. \r\nSo we already paid for this (130$).\r\n\r\nThe crews job is to make the trip as memorable as possible. They should be friendly, cheerful and helpful. Prepare food and drinks and what else the tour offers. \r\nSo we paid for this either (130$). \r\n\r\nWhat would not include the paid costs would be if the crew member would do me a favour and record me with MY OWN actioncam. Then I understand that this is an extra service and would be happy to tip. \r\n\r\nBut other then that. NO SORRY agency. Pay your employees yourself with the money your already demanded from us! ",

The number did not work so we knocked on the door using their clever door knocker method. Miguel greeted us so warmly! He has three rooms with private baths, all overlooking the valley. There is also a pool. He is an architect and built this place himself - you can definitely tell, there's so much character. You can pull into the parking area, but maybe a 7' height max. There is also a whole floor, again open air and overlooking the valley that is a communal cooking area. About a 10 min walk to centro. I can't recommend this place enough. 600p per night for two people in a single with our dog, a little steep, but so worth it.\r\n\r\nFYI, this town has insanely steep hills, we had to put the truck in 4L to get up certain streets.",

In San Miguel de Allende we had to open the engine again because of an gasoline leak. The gaskeds the mechanic used were broken. Cannot recommend this place!",

It consists of about a km hike or cycle through the forest to the cave mouth, then 90-odd minutes checking out the snakes and the bats, the aquatic life inside a small cenote within the cave, and some marine fossils which apparently date back to the Jurassic era. \r\n\r\nNecessarily an evening tour, $630pp. Kids are welcome from aged 10 and up, same price. It's pretty physical (and not for the claustrophobic, or bat or snakephobic!), take closed shoes and comfy clothes, and water. You'll get hot and sweaty, and probably a bit dirty. Hard hats, gloves, headtorch and facemasks provided.\r\n\r\nApparently best end August till May (we were there in July and just saw a couple of - disappointingly inactive, though I'm sure not from the bats' perspective! - snakes; it's mating season and they're mostly hiding out deep in the cave where humans can't access them!). \r\n\r\nThere are also comfortable cabañas available nearby for $700 (mosquito nets, hot and cold running water etc) - I'm sure they'd have no problem with people parking up for the night in the village, or in the lovely quiet cabañas parking area. Small village so come prepared in terms of food and water etc.\r\n\r\nContact Baltazar on 997 977 4920 to arrange.",

There is a small white booth out at the parking lot. Drive there and get in line to get your vehicle inspected and photographed. Your TIP will be canceled here. Since we payed the deposit with credit card, we will get it reimbursed within a few days. If you paid cash, you may have to go to the Banjercito inside the silver building.?\r\n4. Park your vehicle and go inside the building to the customs counter. Have your FMM taken and passports stamped with the exit stamp\r\n5. Drive to the veery back of the line (right lane) which I mentioned earlier you should bypass.\r\n6. Stay in the line which will take you across the bridge to US Imigration. There is one last toll both before the bridge which charges 30pesos for Autos. We are US citizens with a US registered van so fairly simple process, no idea what it would be for non citizens.

I opted to visit Tuliman - $100 entry fee. There are three zones within it, where you can park and check out the sights. The first is the main huge falls, the second a longer walk (steep for the first bit) to a suspension bridge and a big hollow tree, plus a thermal pool for bathing (been closed since the pandemic and still is at the time of writing) and the third to a smaller waterfall and the confluence of two rivers.\n\nThere are other activities throughout the park, including ziplines and canopy bridges, tree climbing etc, all for an extra fee. Lots of restaurants and michelada stalls open till 6pm. If you want to camp there's a spot down in zone 3, fine for vans or tents - lots of space for big rigs too if they can manage the road. $50 fee, toilets and solar-heated showers, option to have.a fire, and there's a BBQ grill. Lovely and peaceful, plenty of shade from the trees. Nice trip out from beautiful Zacatlan!\n\nIt's a very steep drive down, need decent brakes coming down and traction going up!",

Then you have to walk all the way up to the top of the mountain, is a bit steep, in about 10-15 minutes you will arrive to the camping area. And then choose your camping area and enjoy!! The camping area has toilets (very clean!! 👏🏾). And the owner has some grills were you can cook, and you can buy to the hosts the firewood. \n\nVery nice people run the place.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Go light with the equipment, in may make a difference with the hike.\n2. Take your own groceries, there’s a tiendita very close to the camp entrance.\n3. Use a waterproof tent, cause the weather get crazy some times.\n4. In weekends try to arrive the earliest you can get, so you can set up with the best views. \n5. It gets chilly in summer nights, and it’s very cold all winter. \n6. You can reserve by phone one spot, but you can’t choose until you get there. \n7. Enjoy the beautiful sunset, the amazing starry sky and the increíble foggy morning.\n\nThe price I got was $150.00 pesos, about $8 US\n\nCheck out the Instagram and Facebook, I’ll put the links:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063595659125\n\nhttps://instagram.com/camp_derramaderodebucareli?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nSorry if I made writing mistakes, I’m practicing my English skills. \n\nHave fun and ride safe.",

Patchy Telcel reception (better from the edge). They have dogs and chickens so you'd need to keep pets under control, but all seems pretty chilled.

Therefore we asked the community center and they said it’s not a problem at all because the parking lot is not a public park. \n\nThe space is large enough for several vehicles. It is quiet and no one disturbed us. Good place to stay in Santa Fe where free overnight parking seems difficult to find. ",

There are ten sites, each with a picnic table, a BBQ pit, a fire pit, a large tent pad, and a parking spot. There is also a large parking lot for extra vehicles or for day use. The day use area has several BBQ pits and tables. There are also pit toilets, and a water spigot, although we didn't check if it worked since we always carry plenty just incase. Two trail heads start at this site. It is located about 55 minutes NW of Luray on the 675. The road in is good, but narrow and winding. Very beautiful. You can stay for free up to 21 days! US National Forests are amazing. The photos we've included are of different sites. The blue dot on the screenshot is Wolf Gap, the green marker is Luray, VA, for reference. No generators, please. Keep this peaceful place peaceful.\r\n\r\n",

There is room for roughly a half dozen vehicles, or a couple of modately-sized off-road campers. While we've never encountered other campers there, it is evidently a popular spot.

They are patrolled by both state troopers and highway patrol and I would think are pretty safe. California has a lot of vagabond travelers through (vehicle, bicycle and foot) so be sure to lock your stuff up. These rest areas may be just the thing for the camper trying to put in a long day, or one that has run out of affordable options.",

There are warm showers ($0.50/5 min) and running water in the washrooms. The water from the taps along the campsite loops was drinkable as well. There is a short nature walk that takes you through the Redwood glades and then along the bank of the Smith River. The River also has a day-use area and beach that was pretty cool as well. The water is crystal clear, and we spent some time at the Day-use area swimming once we had reached the noon check-out time. The sneaky idea is to make sure you do not pass through the park exit before going to the day use. The Campground also sells firewood and has great pits for mingling with your neighbors after dark.",

The pay parking ends at 20:00 and then it is free until 08:00 weekdays and weekends.

As well, a large gravel area circles most of the paved road as well, so many large units can pull over. The west side of the Rest area also has some trees that one can pull their vehicle between to get more shade/ wind cover. Semi trailers have a separate lot to park in.\n\nThe washrooms are clean enough for a high traffic Rest area, but staff were there early cleaning up (so use the facilities after they clean). Garbages are all over the place, as are the shaded and non-shaded tables. No outside water source found, but there are vending machines on site. \n\nGood place, but It was a little loud. The trucks (of course) run all night and there is a train that passes the Rest area once every hour (at least). There must be an unmarked crossing on the tracks, as the trains blow their horn three or four times each time. ",

There is a walking trail (Trail of Blue Ice) on the other side of the highway that we took all the way up to Byron Glacier and back. It’s a great path and was about 10 miles round trip. The spot by the forest is the best spot, but every night it seems like several other campers accumulate in the open area at the entry to the spot. No big deal and everyone has been friendly. Lots of locals come and trout fish in the lake. We saw several bald eagles and a moose went for a swim in the pond one morning just after breakfast. We have been traveling for 6 weeks straight, so we decided to take a break for a bit. We ended up staying here for 6 nights. Great spot. We came by here 8 years ago and thought it was a nice spot, so we returned. Glad we did. Decent cell coverage.",

    "description": "Nogales, Sonora, Mexico has  TWO  border crossings from Nogales, Arizona, USA.  There is a city center crossing from near the en of Interstate 19 using the old main streets of both towns and it is open 24/7. \r\n\r\nIn the Mexican Nogales, it delivers you onto Calle Lopez Mateos which runs south and turns into Mex 15, the main highway to Mexico City and all points between and anywhere else in Mexico.  The second crossing is several kilometers to the west, served by the Mariposa Road, an industrial truck bypass from I-19. This crossing is open only a limited time each day for the duration between 6h and 22h. This route becomes the Libramiento in Mexico which runs south in a wandering track through mainly industrial sites and connects with Mex 15 at the far south edge of town\r\n\r\nFor anybody visiting Mexico, it is not necessary to stop here in Nogales at either crossing to obtain the requisite Tourist Card and Temporary Vehicle Import Permit (TVIP) for the vehicle. These documents are issues at a roadside Customer and Immigration Terminal alongside Mex 15 twelve km south of the city at the km 257 marker. This facility is open 24/7 and has a Banjercito present. They will accept payment for all the documents and the compulsory TVIP security deposit. Major credit cards are readily accepted. Do have a stash of US dollar cash on you sufficient to cover the $400 maximum TVIP security deposit should the credit card be refused by the computer for some odd reason.    \r\n\r\nFor travelers coming north on Mex 15 and aiming to cross back into the USA, this roadside terminal is where you must stop to cancel your documents and get the refund for the TVIP security deposit.    Nogales is in the \"frontier zone\" and you may travel around in that area, up to the roadside terminal, without need for a TVIP and with no need for a tourist card if the visit is 72 hours less.

Camping was $14.00 per vehicle, see Glen Canyon website for entry fees. \r\n\r\nThe campsites are mixed from being right on the beach front, to being further back (and uphill a bit). You can essentially camp where you want, so long as you are not off the sand roads. Many ATV's on the beach, but it is not really an off road area so people are pretty respectful of the land and it is kept in good shape. \r\n\r\nThere is a decent number of pit toilets that have flush systems, but drinking water is not available at these toilets. Toilets are scattered across the camping area. washrooms with running water are a short distance away from the camping, and do include outdoor (mild temperature) showers. \r\n\r\nFires are allowed but need to be kept to a decent size, and many pits are already dug and lined with rocks. Wood can be purchased at the Greenhaven Estates gas station about 3 miles from the main road entrance. \r\n\r\nThe beach is great for swimming but does not get deep very fast. Many boats put in and/or pull up right on the beach, and the majority of vehicles are larger RV's and 5th wheels. Some spots however are pretty soft sand and people can get stuck - low clearance sports cars are NOT recommended. \r\n\r\nBeautiful, family oriented primitively camping. Good place to be on a warm day! ",

Probably the cheapest place in town and ok if you're in a pinch or very cost concious. Has parking lot that should fit even big rigs. $ 5 extra for parking. Not secured or gated. I parked my motorcycle by the side entrance, near the \"grotto\" and had no problem. Had it covered. Place could be very nice but is poorly managed. Staff was friendly. Has WiFi but at extra charge, per day.",

    "description": "There are a half dozen sites around Sooner Rocks, and the best two are the one we stayed in (located north of the wash on the right as you are heading south, with some shade and wind protection from some big sandstone rocks) and right at the wash in some tamaracks. This area can be very windy so some wind breaks are valuable. Climbing back onto the Sooner Rocks offers great views of the Straight Cliffs, as well as the slickrock around the Escalante River. No Verizon service.\r\n\r\nThe site we stayed in had a bit of a dip preventing a Honda CR-V from driving all the way, but anything higher off the ground would be ok. The Hole-in-the-Rock Road at this point requires medium clearance and good tires, but is passable for small SUVs/crossovers. Overall this area is pretty hot by May but there is all-day shade at this site. Great place to stay if doing a loop hike of Fortymile/Willow Gulch.",

A guy ahead of us in a Jeep Patriot had to turn around, which was quite harrowing considering the narrow trail and how steep the canyon is...My wife cursed at me throughout the entire ascent, our cat was terrified, I kept my calm but I must admit I had sweaty palms. Eventually the trail becomes manageable at the bottom of the canyon. It is quite an experience. Gemini Bridges are a few miles away and well worth the drive along relatively good dirt roads that would still require 4x4. We found out once we reached Gemini Bridges that you can get to the site via HWY 313, and the trail is much more civilized but not as \"fun\". ",

The only camping near the hot springs that is allowed, is about 1/2 mile before you get to the parking lot. There are numerous signs posted saying no camping and visitors say it’s allowed because they read it on this site. Don’t get me wrong, I love your site! This place is in danger of being closed due to people illegally camping and leaving a lot of trash.

They have cabins for rent, or you can camp in your tent or vehicle (no hookups for vehicles). The beach itself is a gorgeous bay, good for swimming. We camped in our rental car, which was about $10 per person, per night. Upside was a view of the ocean and sunrise from our site, downside was the incredible racket of roosters early in the morning. The vehicle camping area only has outdoor showers, not sure about other areas. Toilets were relatively clean. It got a bit rowdy on the weekend, with large groups making some noise, but not too bad. There's a food truck on site that's open in the earlier part of the day, if you're in need of a cup of coffee or breakfast/lunch. One major downside is that the gate to the campground is locked at 7 pm each night, so if you're out exploring you have to be sure to return in time. As far as I know, no wifi, but cell service was fine.",

I do NOT recommend this place at all, unless you are just in need of a place to crash for the night. The wayside has composting toilets - great that it's so environmentally friendly, but man do they smell! Not pleasant for a whole evening. Additionally, the site is directly on the side of a deserted stretch of highway and seems kind of sketchy. The site itself is a 3-sided structure with a couple of picnic tables. There are signs at the wayside that say no camping in your vehicle, which wasn't stated on the website - we slept in our car in the main parking lot, but the next day we saw some people who had driven their car onto the grass by the campsite, which may have been more pleasant despite being closer to the highway. Needless to say, no wifi - and also no cell reception (T-Mobile). Also, no drinking water! I read that there's a cool hike in Manuka State Park, but we didn't stay long enough to do it - so that may be its redeeming factor.",

There's a large open grassy area where people put their tents, although we just camped in our car in the parking lot. There wasn't an official around to check that we had paid for a permit, so you could probably get away with not paying. There seemed to be a lot of people sleeping in their cars. There had been a surf competition that day, and a live band was playing in the evening. Lots of people but not TOO rowdy. There are outdoor showers, toilets, port-a-potties, etc. Gorgeous view in the morning.

It's first come, first serve, and since we wanted to drive around and didn't have a tent to set up in order to save a car camping spot, the woman sold us a walk-in tent pass for $10, and said it was fine for us to sleep in our car in the small parking lot.

    "date_verified": "2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z",
    "description": "This last weekend my girlfriend and I stayed for two nights within the first area of campsites just West of the initial RD 287 access point, a few yards from the creek itself.\r\n\r\nI went a day early to scope out the area since I found bits and pieces of info online but nothing too detailed about this specific area. This campsite is all dispersed camping. Up RD287 (North) there are a few sites scattered on the left and right, the top-most being what looked like the biggest and most secluded, though it was taken when I saw it. The other spots seemed in rough shape but that could have been an illusion as I didn't actually get out to check any of these spots up this road. I considered these spots the official \"Smith Creek Campground\" as labeled on the map, and even though I'm sure the whole area uses this label, I'm gonna call this area SCC.\r\n\r\nAlmost directly across the street from SCC to the south (back on Highway 96), just to the west a few yards is an entrance to a couple sites on the creek side of the highway (I'll call these \"Creekspots #1\"). But these camping areas seemed lived-in and definitely weren't being maintained or cleaned. It was sad, tbh. But I kept driving west, and not even a few hundred yards farther West from the Creekspots #1 entrance on 96 was another entrance with a sign that read \"Wanted: Your fire DEAD OUT\", and this one led to a number of sites. I'll call this area Creekspots #2.\r\n\r\nThe first couple camping areas in Creekspots #2 had nice parking and were easily accessible by car or truck. I parked here initially since I was in a Camry just scoping out the place. There was a road up which I eventually walked up that looked like it was better suited for trucks, jeeps, or brave car-drivers only. So I stayed parked near the entrance. A short walk had me to the creek and there were a couple spots to the left (East) and many more spots up to the right (West). The creek was audible from this entire area, btw. At the time, no spots were occupied, that I could tell. It was pretty clean and user-maintained too, especially after what I'd seen at Creekspots #1 and up SCC.\r\n\r\nI walked near the creek and followed it up, between the creek and the road, and came across some 1 or 2 more 1-4 person areas. Up the little Creekspots #2 Rd just a walk was a bigger, open area that the road cut through. A few of the spots seemed to be taken over by ants but for the most part, the spots all seemed ready for easy camping. All the spots I saw had remnants of old campfires. The road kept going across the creek, accessible by braver people with 4WD to what looked like at least 1 more site, but it could have been dozens more for all I know; I didn't get a chance to get across, the water was running pretty good (mid-May).\r\n\r\nThere were a few more even farther west than the road went, where you can walk a trail that goes for maybe a hundred or so yards. It could have even gone further, but there was a point where I decided I wasn't going to lug my stuff any further since I wasn't preparing for a backpacking-style camping trip.\r\n\r\nWe came back the next day in a truck and I drove past the first couple obvious parking spots available right as you pull in to the second obvious parking spot that was a single spot, perfect for me to back up the truck. (Careful for big rocks in the ground)\r\n\r\nWe stayed here and it was beautiful. The creek is yards away, far enough to have to walk to it but close enough to always hear it steadily flowing. It's serenely peaceful in the morning, of course. I don't know what this place looks like once the camping season really gets started but our mid-May trip was fantastic and I'm excited to come back and try it again.\r\n\r\nIf you visit the spots based on my review, please just pick up after yourself. Good camping is only good camping if we work together to keep it that way.",

They got all the parts needed and are really familiar with Bugs, Kombis, Vanagons, Rabbits, Golfs as well as the newer models and do quality work.

There were only a few others campers (also in tents) when we were there. OK for trucks and camper vans but entry road is likely not accessible for big rigs.

Free. \r\n\r\nADMIN NOTE: user reports: \"The campgrounds are further down the road (approximately 2 1/4 miles from Generals Highway), and are well marked.

Further down the well-worn dirt road were a handful of campsites, a cul-de-sac at the bottom had walking access to another open area by the lake where you could easily fit a half-dozen tents. We got 7 overland Jeeps/Toyotas to fit, and had an fire going in the fire pit. \r\n\r\nThere was a ports-potty on site, as well as a spigot at the top of the hill, though we didn't test the functionality of it. Definitely a great place if you need to set a tent or park an SUV sized or smaller rig for the night.\nNo generators, please.",

All the roads (14 miles of it) are sand roads. This is a solitude beach heaven unlike any other on the east coast. Yo can literally drive on the beach if that is what you want to do. It is simply amazing! \r\n\r\nHOW TO GET THERE WITH YOUR RV: You have to get to Davis, North Carolina and take the Ferry from there to Cape Lookout (about three miles off shore). YOU MUST MAKE A RESERVATION AHEAD OF TIME (http://davisferry.com/). If you are the only one getting there, you will have the VIP treatment on their \"one vehicle\" ferry. We could not believe it the first time we went there but boy was it fun to ride with two feet of your rig hanging over the back of the small ferry. Otherwise it is a four vehicle ferry. Once you are on Cape Lookout you may go wherever your heart desires. Just remember that you cannot camp within 100 yards of any structure and there are very few structures indeed. \r\n\r\nBathrooms and showers (HOT SHOWERS) can be used at the Cabin area. There are no showers at the lighthouse but there are bathrooms. These are the only two places where there are bathrooms and they are ten miles apart.\r\n\r\nYou can climb the lighthouse or you may also visit the old, and abandoned, Cape Lookout Coast Guard Station. \r\n\r\nNATURE TIP:  If you are here on a full moon during the summer, you can literally simultaneously watch the Moon rise on the east while the sun sets on the west. We have never seen anything like it in our lives. It is simply beautiful beyond believe. \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n",

From what I read online the area has been decontaminated (asbestos, uranium). There is a nuclear waste dump in town. On the web it said the soil right next to the pads was problematic, so maybe not the ideal sandpit for your kids or the dog. Also, asbestos concerns (and shattered glass) would deter me from popping my tent in one of the remaining structures or on that soil.",

Tight, steep drive down or up the gravely access road.\r\n\r\nSimple hike to the Smith river to the right of the third site. Great views and swimming. Mind the algae bloom and stay out of the pools with it. \r\n\r\nNo amenities but a porta-potty occasionally at the top of the access road. ",

You can find sun or shade, with spaces in between the trees.  I had good T-Mobile cell service, so was able to get some online stuff done.\r\n\r\nAt 6400 ft elevation, it was a welcome breath of cool air compared to the lower elevations.

You can easily use their facilities for a day, or go hiking there, too. (There's an old mica mine that's pretty interesting.)\r\n\r\nJust drive down the dirt forest road, and you'll see a selection of spaces, some sunny, some shady. This is a boondocking spot, so no facilities.  Just a fairly quiet place to camp.  There was nobody else here when I stayed.  A little bit of traffic noise, but quiet at night.\r\n\r\nThe dirt road in was fine when I was there, but the ruts indicate it could be a problem if it's been rainy.",

Fabulous desert vistas, sunsets, and sunrises. you can even go further out for more privacy, although these spots are nicely spaced. It's a little bit hard to find level as the spots are bumpy. Usable T-Mobile service, but my Verizon phone didn't do as well.\r\n\r\nDirt road with various pullouts. *Please use existing pullouts and don't create more due to local issues with campers and also there is lots of deep sand that only looks solid*\r\n\r\nPrivate property, camping was previously allowed by sculpture artist/owner (although he died a few years ago, and there have been some locals unhappy with the campers here over the past two years). \r\n",

The campground is a long 22 mile drive on a dirt/gravel so 4X4 and decent ground clearance is recommended. You can bring an RV or trailer but it may be tough given the road conditions. It's ONLY OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS (Fri/Sat/Sun check-in, leave on Monday) and limited to 7 spots (we called ahead to reserve a spot)- $10 per night.\r\n\r\nIt is a short drive to the river, hikes or camp headquarters. Potable water and hot showers are available at the headquarters, and the rangers are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. \r\n\r\nNote: You will have to hike .9 miles to the river, so don't expect to lug heavy watercraft. We loaded our inflatable SUPs on our back and do no regret it one bit though. We floated the entire day on the Devil's River and the views/fishing were well worth the trek. We were the only people on the river the entire time, but have heard it can be well traveled in other months/conditions.",

Just past the parking lot is AZ State Trust Land on both sides of the road, and is off limits. Lots of ranchers have leases to graze their cattle and don't seem to appreciate folks camping there. There are safer spots closer to Wickenburg and near Congress (Ghost Town Rd). I would not recommend staying on Alamo Rd beyond the parking area, close to 93, unless you want hassled. :(  ",

The campsites have to be picked out in advance and paid for there as well. There is backcountry($5/night) primitive ($8/day) and equestrian ($2 per day/horse). We picked Grassy Banks because it has an outhouse and is on their river. There is a boat launch and I highly recommend site #15. It’s on the river and close to bathroom. There is a picnic table and a fire ring. No running water or WiFi here. That seems to be the same throughout the park (minus the outhouse) ",

To Jacksonville FL USA\r\nFord Truck with Pop-Up Camper via RORO. \r\n \r\n(Too tall to fit into container by 4\".)\r\n\r\nARGENTINA PROCEDURES:\r\nWe contacted Wave Logistics (Montevideo) (iOverlander listing) via email while we were in Chile and indicated we were interested in shipping to USA. \r\n\r\nAfter a few days we finally heard back from Martin Flores (operaciones@capri-arg.com.ar) (011 5031 4015) who told us about a KLine ship going to Jacksonville in five days. Could we get to Zarate Arg. In that time?\r\n\r\nWe could and we did. \r\n\r\nBut in the meantime we asked via email where exactly to drop off the truck, how much, what documents were necessary and what were the procedures exactly. \r\n\r\nMartin said we would need to get the following to get the process going: (which we emailed to him):\r\n 1. Owner's passport copy including page with Arg. Entrance. (Husband). \r\n 2. Vehicle Title copy (luckily our Title named and Owner name are the same.)\r\n 3. Make, Model, year, height, width and length dimensions and weight details. \r\n 4. Argentina TIP paper. \r\n\r\nAlso he said we would need the originals at the Port.\r\n\r\nAnd after numerous requests via email, he finally gave us a quote of:\r\nA. Argentina fees $500 (cash at Port in Arg. Pesos)($9 per cubic foot)\r\nB. KLine shipping fee $2800\r\nC. USA port fees $500\r\n\r\nMartin told us to go directly to Port Security (correct gps coordinates in iOverlander) and he would send us the Bill of Lading. And that we should contact Ignacio Luna at the Port upon arrival. \r\n\r\nWe arrived at Port at 8 am on Friday, Jan. 19th and parked in the small parking lot to the right of the Security gate, but Ignacio didn't arrive until 9 am and Security didn't have the Bill of Lading (BOL). Finally after Ignacio arrived and Security had the BOL, they had a security guard drive us and another gentlemen shipping his hard-sided truck camper to the Payment Office. \r\n\r\nThere, after the BOL was sent electronically, we both paid $583 even though quite clearly his vehicle was bigger, longer and heavier. \r\n\r\nWe walked back to Security Office, showed payment receipt to Security Office Clerk and received stamped receipt, unloaded all passengers and luggage that wasn't being shipped in truck, and the Owners were directed to drive through security dates and directed to a section further in the Port. We had taken everything loose out of truck cab and put into camper before we drove to the port. Only had a large locked storage bin in truck cab. \r\n\r\nAnd turned over the truck key only. No inspections of any sort and they returned to the Security Gate where Security called two taxis to take us to the Buenos Aires (BA) bus terminal. \r\n\r\nProcess took approx. 2\r\n1\u00261/2 hours after BOL arrived. \r\n\r\nFirst needed to buy a transportation card called a Sube and put enough fare on it to pay for the bus ride into BA. \r\n\r\nThe next day Martin emailed us the BOL and told us to check http://apps.klineglobalroro.com/tracking/ for estimated arrival date in Jacksonville using the BOL#. \r\n\r\nHe also later informed us when the ship actually left Zarate on Jan. 24th. \r\n(We also found vesselfinder.com to be handy tracking the vessel by name.)\r\n\r\nUS PROCEDURES:\r\nWe flew into Miami and traveled around FL ( and Cuba) while waiting for ship's arrival.\r\n\r\nFinally on Feb. 27th, we contacted KLine, Jim Randolph, RICBCARCUS@us.kline.com, on when, where, how to pay and procedures to get truck out of the Port. \r\n\r\nHe gave us a contact Lisa Cotman, Lisa.Cotman@us.kline.com. \r\nK” Line America, Inc.\r\nRo/Ro Services\r\nPCC IMPORT CUSTOMER SERVICE\r\nPhone: ‪866-233-6875‬ OPT 3\r\nEMAIL: ricbcarimp@us.kline.com\r\n\r\nAfter a number of emails, she sent a \"Delivery Order template\" to complete and instructions on how to make payment. ONLY via wire. \r\n\r\nWe wired the funds of $3114 on Monday 5th and sent email same day to KLine advising them of wire details.\r\n\r\nThree days before Estimated Time Arrival (ETA), we received an \"Arrival Notice and Invoice\" with more info via email. \r\n\r\nThen I called KLine again on Friday 9th (ETA) to find out if ship was in Port (although VesselFinder.com said it hadn't arrived yet.) \r\n\r\nI had to send the wire info email again to Lisa since wire hadn't posted. \r\n\r\nWe had to make several calls to Customs since KLine didn't lift the Hold notice.  We called Customs on Friday 9th and they advised us to call again on Monday 12th which we did. \r\n\r\nFinally we showed up at US Customs \r\n(10426 Alta Dr.) \r\n(Operational Hours: \r\n8:00 AM-5:00 PM (Eastern)\u2028Weekdays (Monday-Friday)\r\nPhone: \r\n(904) 714-3100, ext. 2)\r\n\r\nat 9am and within 10 minutes they stamped the Arrival Notice. They required \r\n1. BOL, \r\n2. Delivery notice from KLine, \r\n3. Vehicle Title\r\n4. ID for consignee. Passport was acceptable. \r\n\r\nKLine said to call again (866-233-6875, ext. 3) after Customs cleared which we did but was told the wire still hadn't posted. Sent wire info again via email. \r\n\r\nWas advised by Accounting they didn't have info and wanted to know what date wire was sent. Sent another email with that info. \r\n\r\nCAUTION: Keep contacting KLine to ensure they post your payment because nothing gets done without it. \r\n\r\nAfter 20 minutes received word from Accounting that payment had posted and to contact the terminal. \r\n\r\nCalled the terminal and after approx. 10 minute hold, said they had the paperwork and to come on over. (904-757-3357).\r\n\r\n(BLOUNT ISLAND TERMINAL \r\n8998 BLOUNT ISLAND BLVD.

Gate process took approx. 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nEscort led the way in their vehicle with us following directly to storage Lot and directed us to Terminal staff building. \r\n\r\nStaff took papers, made copies and directed us to small side Lot where truck/camper was. Took 10 minutes. (But they take lunch break from 11:45 to 12:45.)\r\n\r\nEscort led the way back to main gate and we were on our way. \r\n\r\n\r\nNo damage to truck. Battery turned over right away. Bag containing shoes inadvertently left in truck cab arrived intact. No inspection at all. Camper not broken into. ",

McDonalds with restroom and wifi next door. Laundry one block, grocers and food nearby. Public library three blocks. Across the street is a police station.\nParked here overnight for six days and nights in a row and didn't get bothered. Not 100% level. Free, no time limit (apart from citywide limit being seven days for cars and 24h for RVs). No parking (street sweeping) Tuesday 9:30-11:00am, but no-one cared and no-one got a ticket.\n\nNow here's the catch. It's only about ten spots at this very location, and there is very little movement, meaning you have to be very lucky to get a spot. Small cars (up to van size) only. Stealth camping probably good idea. Pretty sure you get bothered when popping a roof-top tent or sth. However, there is no law in NYC prohibiting sleeping in vehicles.\nThe neighbourhood as such feels alright though, and you might find another spot nearby. ",

I had a herd of elk in my campsite the other night, which was cool. Verizon service is fast at certain times of the day, and drops to almost unusable at others. I've only seen this type of intermittent slowdown at crowded RV parks when everyone is trying to stream videos at the same time, so I'm assuming that because it's very close to the park entrance that the service may get overwhelmed when there are long lines. I'm showing a consistent 3 bars, but the actual service is anything but consistent. Overall, it was mostly reliable but very slow at times.",

Sometimes the street cleaners don't come along but the police do.  You don't get ticketed if you are sitting there (all the locals will be sitting in their cars too).  If the street cleaners come, they all double park on the other side until they are done and then move back.  You are then good to park until Thursday.  Sundays are a complete free day in New York - you can pretty well park anywhere (even near Times Square).\n\nCoffee in Central Park - walking distance to Times Square.  We also found a spot on the upper west side for a couple of nights.  Walking distance to Central Park at the Hudson parkway.  Give yourself lots of time to find a park - it's worth it to see New York for free accommodation!",

We would not have attempted getting to the site if it were muddy or with rain in the forecast because our truck would leave incredibly deep scars in the earth if it rained \u0026 our little car couldn’t have handed it.  It is in a dry lake bed \u0026 we would highly recommend avoiding it if it’s raining especially if you don’t have 4x4.

    "description": "Decided to explore this Forest Road off NM15 on a whim as it looked pretty with trees lining the start of the road. Shortly after leaving NM15, you enter a beautiful forest that has been totally devastated by fire, so it's extremely interesting to see. The road through it is an easy 2WD road with only a few very minor rockier sections. The forest fire area goes on for about 6km until you reach 2600m in altitude, that's where the trees come alive again. The views are stunning as this road gains altitude quickly through a canyon and from the top you can enjoy the entire fire area.\n\nSome cautions: I would not recommend visiting here on a windy day. These trees still weigh a ton and are ready to topple over. Also, do NOT camp in the forest fire area.\n\nThere are plenty of spots to pull off the road and camp above 2600m. There were also a few spots off to the left side at the start of the road near NM15.",

Great data signal! There is an unmarked trail leading from the site over the hills. We followed it until it petered out. I don't think big rigs could get up this hill, but if you follow other spur roads from that main road that leads to San Lorenzo Canyon, you can find lots of other sites.

Immediately to the right will be a discreet dirt road leading down into the woods. May be doable with 2wd but 4x4 recommended. \r\n\r\nWe parked under the bridge for some shade, and enjoyed the warm river water, teeming with crawdads. Our kids loved it. Seems to be a spot popular with the locals, as we saw a few come and go during the day, but no one else camped there that night. As a bonus, we were treated to an amazing lightning bug display at night.",

    "description": "This is a *free*, legal stretch of Chicago that works great for stealth camping.  Chicago requires permit parking almost everywhere that is residential and pay parking everywhere else, so stealth camping can be a real challenge.  The entire stretch of Blue Island from Ashland to Western is free parking and there is *plenty* of ample parking, with lots of large open spots. Where I have marked, there are green-space plantings and some open lots that are perfect for dumping pee without being a bad neighbor.  It’s very industrial on the south side of the street so there just isn’t much foot traffic or people to worry about.   Plus, it’s right on a bike lane, so if you have bikes, you can quickly plug into Chicago’s terrific bike infrastructure.  The CTA Pink Line El is just a few blocks north, which is a fast and easy way to get to the downtown.  There are also many bus routes in the area.\r\n\r\nYou can find water at any Chicago Park that has a field house, which are free to enter and use.  Some have showers and pools. Most parks also have drinking fountains that operate from spring-fall, but those are a PITA to use for filling water cans. Nearby parks:  Dvorak Park has a historic fieldhouse plus free outdoor swimming pool in the summer from Memorial Day to Labor Day.  Ping Tom Park in Chinatown is super cool.  There is a new fieldhouse/boat house that is free, with beatiful bathrooms, indoor swimming pool, and fitness center.  While Palmisano Park doesn’t have a fieldhouse or water options, it is worth a visit for stellar views of Chicago and a fascinating history (it used to be a quarry!).\r\n\r\nI teach at a nearby high school and have spent several nights camping in my minivan for multiple days with no problems—even without moving the van.  (Note:  normally I take the train and bike commute from the suburbs, but there are times when it’s just too much of a pain due to needing to stay at work until 10 pm for special projects or due to coaching).  I have cooked on a camp stove more than once, in the open, with no one blinking an eyelash. \r\n\r\nChicago moved it’s market district about 10 years ago to just a few blocks south on BI Ave due to gentrification and expansion of the University of IL-Chicago.  As a result, this street gets morning traffic, but is remarkably quiet at night.  It is well lit all night.  As a single female who bike commutes 95% of the time, at all hours, I have never felt in danger or worried here, but I consider myself to be pretty street smart. I don’t see much foot traffic along here other than some of my students going to school and an occasional person waiting for the bus.\r\n\r\nCrime concerns:  I bike this route daily, and I teach at a high school for students that specializes in kids who are in gangs, so I know the ‘hood better than most.  When I spend the night, I put up blackout windows and I don’t leave anything of value visible.  I have seen some broken window glass farther south on Blue Island which usually indicates break ins.  And I see a LOT of graffiti tagging—but mostly on new gentrification digs or public ways.  I think if you left your van in the same place for a week, you might have problems.  If you are moving it every 2 days, even if its just half a block, I don’t think you would need to worry.\r\n\r\nThis is close to downtown, plus it’s in the Pilsen neighborhood, which just got voted one of the 10 best neighborhoods in the world.  There are tons of great food options within blocks, mostly Mexican but also some fusion and new American, mostly on 18th Street.  Check Yelp for ideas. I am addicted to Taqueria Tayahua on Western Ave, which has the best vegetarian quesadillas (on handmade tortillas!) in town.  I die for the Huitlacoche and Flor de calabaza quesas...  For vegans, the famous El Faro is about 1.5 miles away in the Little Village neighborhood.  I also love Sora Temakaria for unusual but delicious sushi options.\r\n\r\nLocals sell excellent tamales \u0026 champurrado at the nearby Plaza Tenochtitlan in the mornings (and sometimes right on the corner of Cermak/Blue Island/Ashland) on all but the most glacial of days.  It’s a cheap and delicious breakfast. You can also find great summertime street food (fresh fruit cups, paletas (popsicles), etc.) on mobile carts around the neighborhood. Speaking of which, the paletas are terrific, in flavors like cinnamon and rice, coconut, fresh strawberry, mango, etc). \r\n\r\nThis location is half a block away from an Aldi, so cheap supplies are at hand if you want to cook your own food.  There are many bodega style small vendors in the neighborhood as well.  If you want to go to a “real” grocery store, check out Pete’s Fresh Market on 18th St., just west of Western Ave. They have a fabulous produce department and a great prepared food area, including a banging salad bar.\r\n\r\nChicago’s excellent Chinatown is a straight shot down Cermak (22nd St), an easy bike ride due east. There are so many delicious restaurants here that I suggest you browse Yelp for specifics. The outdoor mall is pretty cool for strolling around in, but parking is a bear—and you want to pay to park in a nearby lot because of *very* tight free parking lots if you drive it. A bit farther north is the very hip Randolph Street food area, home to many Michelin starred and highly reviewed venues ($$$). There is also a great Greektown, just a half mile north on Halsted.  If you like fish, I can’t recommend Santorini enough.  Finally, little Italy is a bit north and East of here.  If it’s summer, it is well worth going to Taylor Street to get some homemade Italian Ice at Mario’s, and if you eat meat, check out the famous Italian beef at Al’s (although Al’s is open year round).",

    "description": "We checked out all 14 established sites on this road. The majority are definitely meant for tent camping as there are designated pads for your gear, fire rings, and the parking spots are only big enough for cars. Site 13 accommodated our 170” sprinter just fine and it was near the creek (site 9 would be nice too). This would be a great spot in the summer due to the natural wading pool a few feet away. Several cars drove by during the two days we spent here, but otherwise very quiet. I would not recommend any big rigs down this road as it can get very narrow and  bumpy (also too big to fit at sites and no where to turn around). Just an FYI, there is a gate blocking the road not far after site 14 so this is not a thru-road at this time. No amenities and minimal cell service on ATT. Free!",

But it served our purpose, then we happily got out.\r\n\r\nAlso...we went to eat at the Sourdough Saloon which was awful. Everything was broken and disgusting. The fries were good, everything else tasted terrible.  The bathrooms were likely last cleaned sometime in 2017. ",

Once you get off I-10 on the opposite side of the shell you go over the cattle rails and drive maybe a mile or two up and on your left hand side there will be a sign in the bushes for Sierra Vista is you drive in that for maybe 100 meters you will hit the parking lot. There are fire rings and spots for plenty of rigs even large ones. I’ve been there multiple times the first time was a Saturday night and there was one other rig there and cars parked there the next morning to hike the trail, I just parked towards the edge as not to be bothered. The other times when the weather chilled and on weekdays no one was ever in the lot. People do live up the road a little so cars will pass but it’s tucked in the brush enough. It’s a beautiful view for the sunrise and sunset! On one side of the lot I got some LTE Verizon service while on the other side I got no service. There are no amenities but such an amazing spot and so close to El Paso if you do need anything!",

The parking was a tiny bit slanted but not bad. Big rigs could fit in but probably not advisable because boat trailers need room to park unless you come late and leave early. It was fantastic. The pond (about four or more miles long) has at least four springs coming into it so it’s crystal clear with cypress tree groves on each side.

In hindsight, I don't think the road was too risky under normal circumstances. I didn't make it as far down the road as I'd planned, because it was due to rain in the morning and I was worried about getting in too deep. But the drive back out in the rain wasn't too harrowing. There is a sign at the entrance to this road saying the road is closed ahead, but it's unclear at what point it's closed. I didn't encounter any reason for it to be closed, at least as far as I went in. ",

The cost is $3 to dump and if you wanted potable water it’s another $3. Potable water is right next to dump and no one checks if you use it, sooo....\r\n\r\n.We parked at the entrance where the office was and paid there but the kind lady at the desk told me over the phone that when the office is closed you can use the night drop envelopes - put your money in, and slide the envelope under the office door. The dump/water area is the prettiest ones we’ve encountered yet as it overlooks the golf course within the RV park and everything was clean and well taken care of. There was supposed to be a hose attached to the water spigot used to wash down the dump area but the only hose that was there did not have either end that could have connected to the spigot so we just used a collapsible bucket and filled it up a bunch to wash down the area (we have a small Camco toilet in our van). We paid the $3 to fill our water also and it tastes great! Would definitely come here again if we need to make another trip to town. ",

During the daytime, there are definitely a few boats passing by, or in front of the parking lot fishing. there's a large grassy area next to the parking lot which would be perfect for a tent. It can get a little windy, so I can imagine it might be a bit cold at night, even during the summer. After a good night's sleep or if you just need a peaceful day trip, you can do some fishing on the cemented pathway.... or just watch the big expensive boats pass by. \r\nOfficial personnel does pass by in boats as well - Coast guard? Water police? \r\n\r\nOnce you make a left turn for that final mile, it is all gravel, but it's not bad. Going slow, my old grrl, made the the one mile without any problems. There's definitely room for a couple of big rigs up to you maybe 35 ft. Possibly bigger if you are really good at making tight u-turns.  there's plenty of room for camper vans/ Sprinters / large class B's. \r\n\r\nWiFi\r\nSunny spot for solar panels: \r\nDog /cat friendly: No signs \u0026 lots of grass\r\nFishing\r\n\r\n",

Some can be surprisingly deep and soft bottomed.\r\nThere are many other iOverlander entries listing free dispersed camping in the Point Washington forest.

But the couple left around 5pm and, when I asked if I would park overnight they told me they had no jurisdiction and they don't care.  They said they doubted that anyone would bother us, and no one did.  There are restrooms here, but closed at the moment for winter.",

Gorgeous views, very quiet.\r\nTo get there, highway 191 north turn right onto 162, which follows the river. Just before mile marker 3 there is a cattle guard and dirt road going to a broad bluff off to the right. A loop road appears very quickly on your left taking you out to the campsite on the bluff edge. Only room for 3 or so large rigs out there.",

There is also a newly fenced-in dog park which is a huge bonus. We can't say anything for the bathrooms or other facilities but google reviews all sounded like its a well kept place. Only downsides are the highway noise and no facility access after hours. All in all, great place to overnight when you don't wanna end up in a casino or Walmart parking lot.

A truck with an overcab camper went up the whole road presumably with 4wd and they didn’t come back down before I left in the morning so I assume there’s more pull offs up the road as well. ",

Two locals showed up and went further down the road and came back an hour later. One was in a Camry and didn’t seem to have any issues. The road is gravel but there are some very large rocks mixed in. If airing down your tires is something you’re into I would definitely advise that. Just take your time and pick your route wisely and you’ll be just fine in any rig. If you come in from Roswell like I did, the elevation gain is very subtle so check weather before coming in. My buddy heater struggled with the altitude. Up the road 5 minutes is a town that has many restaurants and cafes as well as a Family Dollar. Cute place. 2-3 bars of T-Mobile 5G! 10/10 spot! ",

There's quite a bit of traffic as there's a private road just above where we parked. There were also many locals that came in with their dogs to access the river. A horse arrived just before sunset to graze on grass and daisies right by our camp. Our best guess is he belonged to a nearby neighbor. He was a welcome visitor. No cell service at camp, but was able to get a weak signal near the river. Definitely not a long term spot while the campground is closed, but a good overnight option in a pinch.

    "description": "This is a National Forest Service campground on the lake side of the road. There is also a second campground directly on the opposite side of the road. All campground camping is $30 night +$2 extra on holidays. Half price with national parks pass. \r\n\r\nIt has more than 100 sites—some in the trees, some in a more exposed area with a granite Boulder background. \r\n\r\nWe were here on a Wednesday night, so it was quiet as far as campers go. There is definitely road noise, but it quiets down at night. The sites are pretty close to each other, so you better like your neighbors. There was a fair amount of trash here, and I’m not sure if it’s from the campground or blown up from the lake. \r\n\r\nThe main road in has a great site set into the boulders—dont camp here. I did. This seems to be a main thoroughfare for local traffic at all times of the day to blast through to the day use part of the lake that is accessible, then blast out. Stay up in the trees...more road noise, less local, weird, suspicious traffic. For what it’s worth, I felt safe here even with the suspicious in and out traffic—they just drive faster than anyone ever should in a campground. Keep an eye on your kids and pets. \r\n\r\nThe instructions say to find a spot and occupy it, and a “uniformed“ for a service officer will come by and take your payment. A woman came by to take my payment, but she was wearing super short “juicy“ shorts and a printed tank top. She did, however, have California government plates and she filled out the paperwork and gave us a slip to put on our site post.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other options in the area. I have stayed directly on the shore of the lake in the national Rec area. If I come back this way, I’ll do that again and avoid this campground. It wasn’t terrible, but as I listen to the local Harley fire up it’s pipes before 8am to leave after being here 15 minutes this morning...it kinda sucks. \r\n\r\n*I had my Tundra and 24’ toy hauler and it is TIGHT in here. My friends had their 28’ RV and it was super tight. I wouldn’t recommend anything over those sizes. ",

Thought this location would allow you to camp at the banks of the lake, but was wrong.  I didn't see another human being in the 34 minute drive up to the location, but there was a bunch of people there when I got there. The last 25 minutes or so of the drive is nothing but dirt and gravel, and this must get awfully muddy during the rainy season.  Wouldn't go up the mountain in this weather unless you have 4wheel drive. But, in late April, my 2wd Mobile Traveler motor home made it up the hill fine.  There is one stretch that has some serious potholes in the dirt and gravel.  If you have a luxury car, keep it at home.  I saw one guy with a BMW trying to get up this road.  Don't bring it up here.  Also, leave your big rigs at home.  This location is good for tent camping and very small trailers. \r\n\r\nI found a good camping spot and made camp.  At one point, someone turned off my generator at around 9:20PM at night, and stole the magnet I had on the side of my vehicle.  They also opened up the black water tank valve.  So, keep an eye on your stuff when here. \r\n\r\nWent fishing one day and enjoyed myself.  Nothing was biting.  There were tons of tiny fish in the lake, but the the big ones weren't biting.  \r\n\r\nThe weekend had a number of drunken characters who were speaking language you wouldn't want your kids to hear.  By Sunday, 90% of everyone was gone.  It was quiet and relaxing.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to arrive on a Sunday or Monday.   \r\n\r\nAlso, bring plenty of garbage bags.  People don't seem to know how to clean up after themselves.\r\n\r\nA pit toilet is there.  This is National Forrest Service Land.",

I got confirmation from staff at the Visitor's Center as I needed someplace more accessible (I have a 2WD campervan; most other areas in the park need 4WD due to the sand.) No amenities. It's mostly a trailhead for hiking; we saw about a dozen people total Wednesday \u0026 Thursday in late February.",

There are toilets in one shower if you need it. You can walk to nearby restaurants in about a half a mile. There was good AT\u0026T and Verizon service is this and is in the middle of town. It is big rig friendly. You may use the dump at a site if a site is open but if they’re all taken there is no standalone dump.",

At the end of the meadow there is a little rutted side road. It’s short, takes you through some trees and bushes to a nice open area with a Forest Service weather station. Surrounded by beautiful aspen groves, and views of the valley and V Rock. AT\u0026T and T-Mobile working pretty good - between 1 and 2 bars. The little side road is the only dicey bit as it’s narrow and rutted. Made it in our Transit van just fine, and 2WD would probably do fine if it’s not muddy. Great spot!",

We were here on a weekend and it was crazy crowded so it was nice being off the busy road where tons of people were camping. Several smaller pull offs along this road, probably for smaller cars and maybe tent camping. We were wary about what spots were up for grabs, but there weren’t any “no camping” signs or “private property” marked anywhere along this small road. Another camper was parked at the very end of the road in the dead end and there were so many other people camping in the NF when we came I doubt they patrol it or care. No signal (Verizon).

I stayed at a very spacious paddle-in site, which I reserved online.\r\n\r\nIn addition to camping, the park offers several amenities: hiking and paddling trails, canoe rentals, picnic tables and shelters, fishing, and a visitor center with snacks, drinks and exhibits.\r\n\r\nDecent cell service with Verizon.\r\n\r\nPark website:  https://www.ncparks.gov/merchants-millpond-state-park/home\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions are from the park's website.  Note: prices vary depending on type of site and season.\r\n\r\nTent and trailer camping\r\nThe family campground is in the midst of a pine/hardwood forest just beyond the park office. Twenty campsites for tents and trailers offer picnic tables and grills. A washhouse with drinking water, restrooms and showers serves the campground. There are no electrical hookups, water or dumping station.\r\n \r\nGroup camping\r\nOrganized groups will enjoy a stay in the walk-in group camping area or in a canoe camping group site.\r\nFacilities for the walk-in sites include a small washhouse with a shower. Drinking water is available nearby.\r\n \r\nBackpack camping\r\nReach five campsites for backpack camping by hiking a side trail off Lassiter Trail.\r\nCampers must pack all supplies, including water, to the sites. A pit toilet is nearby.\r\nViews of the \"enchanted forest\" and Lassiter Swamp await those who travel to the backpack camping area.\r\n \r\nPaddle-in camping\r\nReach three canoe camps by way of paddle trails leading from the boat ramp.\r\nOrange markers lead to the family canoe camp with 10 sites. Yellow markers lead to the group canoe camp, which offers three sites. Pit toilets are available, but campers must carry in all supplies, including water, and carry out their trash.\r\nThe third canoe camp is located down Bennett's Creek, approximately 4.5 miles from the boat ramp. Bennett's Creek canoe-in campgrounds are carry-in, carry-out with no restrooms.",

Someone posted that it's not big rig friendly. that's not the case. I've seen massive rigs out here. the river bed is just fine to drive on. Don't be scared!\r\n\r\n",
