No running water whilst we were there but running water was connected outside the house the day we left and Shane is committed to having showers available within the next week or so and wifi in the near future. Not so much a camp site as an experience and you must try grandmas tamales. $10us to camp, $10us each for the very informative monkey tour and$55us each for an evening crocodile tour including guide and canoe.

Camping is free, but we booked the 2 hour tour for next day. It's a family run business and while Juan leads you through the chocolate making process his wife prepares a Mayan lunch (tour \u0026 lunch for 35$ US).",

Beck Falls are maybe the nicest, excellent swimming. Then another 15min to Big Drop Waterfall turnoff (good trail). From this turnoff it is 20min on a extremely steep trail (ropes provided) to Big Drop Fall (swimming difficult). You have to descend 190 altimeters! 20min backtracking to the turnoff. From turnoff (good former logging trail) 1:35min to Park entrance. (On the way you can walk down to an old steam hoist, it is only 170mts). Total walking time: 4:50hrs\n\nWe recommend to hike the other way round because you start with the hard bit and finish with a swimm in Bojawina falls. If you do so start at the park entrence, take the trail between Maya structure (ruin) 2 and 3, after 200mts take the right trail (16.930802 -88.381976).",

I tend to do all my own mechanic work and am pretty picky about the way things are done. These guys were more efficient and more honest than most mechanics in the States.\n\nI was impressed with the facility and staff, so asked about getting an alignment. They told me I'd have to remove the camper, but that it would be no problem.\n\nThen, because this place is legit, they checked out my front end on the spot, to be sure there was nothing wrong that was causing our truck to pull to the left. I watched them check tie rods and ball joints in exactly the same way I would do it and we all came to the conclusion that I had two bad lower ball joints. \n\nThey were able to get the parts the next day (good MOOG ball joints, the same thing I'd install at home) and parts, labor, +alignment would only be $500bzd ($250 US, much cheaper than the US).\n\nWe scheduled for the next day (Because it's stupid hot and doing ball joints without a lift, press, or air tools in a gravel parking lot didn't sound fun to me at all..) and the parts were there just as promised.\n\nHowever, the guy scheduled to do the work double checked the ball joints and found they tightened up with a good greasing. We all decided they didn't actually need replaced, so they just did the alignment for us instead.\n\nGreat, lazer alignment equipment with guys who know how to use it. The truck tracks perfectly now and I'll be sure to grease the ball joints more.\n\nIf you need tires or any mechanic work done at all, stop in and give these guys a try. They seem to do everything from oil changes to anything tire/alignment related. Not sure about engine work, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do the basics.\n\nIn our experience they're very honest, very professional, and they really know their stuff.\n\nAlso, the waiting room is air conditioned and they have WiFi..",

Was very nice though and of course we should only pay the 5 US when that was the original agreement. I guess the real price is 5 US (10 BZ) pr person.

They charge 25 BZD per 24 h secure parking, but as we got back we found our car unlocked. Someone was inside, searched everything and stole - congratulations - a crappy vacuum cleaner. Luckily, all our real left valuables were hidden or stored in locked cupboards, and obviously there was not enough time to open them. The ferry company's reaction was sketchy, as there was no broken window or broken lock they tried to give us the blame. The police was friendly, they told about regular break-ins into cars in the harbour district using some kind of wires or hooks to unlock the doors. We got at least the parking fee back (with help of the police), but the company itself, especially the manager, was not really interested, there was no apology or something like \"oh, we need to improve the security\"... not recommended!",

They have homely grown coffee and cacao what we roasted and grinded together with them. They have a spring on their land and you can drink water from there. They live right on the river bank, so you can get here actually on foot or by boat. Ignacio can also show you around. Downsides: lots of insects, no proper toilet or shower. They speak good English, and the place is beautiful, you can birdwatch or swim in the river. We lost our phone with the exact coordinates so just ask the guy called Eladio chocolattte (around where we dropped the location) where Ignacio lives, it is a 40 mins walk.\r\n\r\nFilip\u0026Eszter",

This eco-friendly company is the only one taking care of the reef and marine life conservation, avoiding to harass animals...and not giving plastic water bags to their clients. Our guides were really nice and knowledgeable, we got to see everything, swim with Manatees, sharks and sting ray! As you go two hours earlier and in smaller groups, you are alone with them. For the same price as the others (65 usd full day; 35usd half day), do not hesitate, well worth the detour. \r\n\r\nSnorkeling was good, just as described before. But when you intend to rent a Gopro-Camera, make sure that there is a second camera on baord in the case that your camera doesn't work or the battery is empty as it happened to me",

It is immediately at the river where you come to the Andersons Laguna (happy go luckie tours start here).\r\nThe owners are incredibly welcoming and helpful. Actually we just wanted to stay one night but we just love it here. They sell their freshly made food for very reasonable prices (10-15blz) and it tastes delicious! They offered us to pay in the end and if we want to drink something to just take and note it.\r\n\r\nYou can sleep in your car/tent for 10blz pP but you also can rent one of the cabañas for 25blz up to 100blz. You can use kayaks and bicycles for free.\r\n\r\nThe bathrooms and cabañas are super clean and set up with love. \r\n\r\nThis is the nicest place we’ve been to so far in Belize.",

He said there’s a community cooperative that sells tickets to visit the Macaws. In return they works to preserve their habitat and maintain the trails.\r\nIf you wish to contact him ahead of time his details are: scarletmacaw246@gmail.com or tel:661-1365. Their FB page is Scarlet Macaw Paradise.\r\nHe offered to guide us or to draw us a map to go on our own. We opted for the self adventure. He charged us $30BZ for two. He also allowed us to camp on his land for the night. There was a water tap where potentially you could fill your tank but I didn’t ask.\r\nThe town is a lovely Mayan town and a very nice to spend a night. Best time to see the Macaws is early morning or late afternoon.",

There is a small RV-sign next to a small building on the road and the entry might be closed with a chain. Just walk in and ask for Alice - the lovely owner that lives here with her daughters. She charged us 25B$ per night. There is WiFi, water, toilets and a private beach. You may hike through the shallow water back to the coast guard or over to the marina.\r\nGreat place to leave your rig (and dogs) when visiting the city or the cayes. A bit run down and simple but has everything you need and you help a widow by staying there instead of the noisy marina...",

The restaurant/bar is open Thursday/Friday from 5-9 pm and Saturday/Sunday from to 12-9 pm (the bar will stay open later). If you want to camp when the restaurant is closed, that’s okay. You just have to contact Justin. There are large men/women restrooms. There is WiFi. They can run an extension cord outside for electricity. There is a large palapa if it’s raining. And a water spigot should be available soon for dishwashing, etc. There is also a pontoon boat for tours down the Belize River (again, talk to Justin for details and to arrange). The price per night is $10 USD or $20 BZD. Fun place to see wildlife: iguanas, crocodiles, etc. We asked Justin if he could accommodate larger RVs, and he said yes if the restaurant isn’t open. ",

Still... within minutes the crater was covered by clouds. Luckily only for a short while though until the clouds started to burn off. As previously posted, no more crater lakes or steam so this is definitely not our most impressive volcano. Really, if you wouldn't know it's a volcano... you wouldn't know. I'd look at this as just a different picture of Costa Rica. An high altitude, alpine landscape with amazing views of the surrounding mountains, valleys and, if you're lucky, oceans. Besides the main view point at the craters, there is another viewpoint up above which is accessible via rough road but wasn't a problem for our camper van.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe asked the guys in the main parking lot if we could spend the night up at the Mirador. We think they said yes, but I won't be surprised if we get kicked out. Price to camp is free. Price to enter park is $23. Restrooms available at the main parking area, as well as a little restaurant. ... And we got kicked out!  Just to be clear, you can totally visit the volcano but you can't camp here. ",

Lots of coconut trees to pick from and a lot of driftwood for fire. The sand may require 4x4 for 30 meters from the road. We had one of our best camping times on this spot. The waves are fun to play with as long as you don't lose your footing and get dragged out. Shade is plenty and the beach is very clean and secluded. Parrots and monkeys are common. If you're lucky you may even see a turtle laying eggs at night. ",

Can have fires in fire pits and plenty of firewood from surrounding area. The road is dirt for the last few k but fine for rigs of any size. Currently there are camping signs with arrows starting at the Iguana Azul hotel which is approx. 1 km away. Camping is to the left or south of the hotel. There is a good sink area in middle of campground for dishes or laundry. The area is groomed so no falling coconuts and lots of flat ground. Bathroom has two showers and two toilets and all clean with toilet seats and paper. ",

Lovely, flat spot with a gorgeous view of Drake Bay. I will claim 100% fault for being lulled into a false sense of security given our location, but we set up our tent, put our tank bags and dry bags under the fly (locked up our valuables on the bikes) and walked 200 meters down the road for dinner. While we were gone, the everything on the side of our tent facing the police station (where two police men were sitting outside for the majority of the time we were there), was gone through and they took whatever they found useful (flashlights, supplies from our first aid kit, tent pegs, etc.). We heard the next morning that this has happened to two other parties who had previously camped there, yet, oddly, the police didn't mention this when we asked them if it was safe to stay there. Hmmmmm... Nice spot as long as you don't walk away from it. ",

Below is a green Bancredito building, or we saw in the Salida Costa Rica building a Exit tax machine which is only $7 (saw too late for us, but you can save yourself $1 if you pay with card). \r\n3. Drive to have your paper worked checked by Costa Rica. This person will take the little piece of paper Aduana gives you and look at your copy of canceled TIP. \r\n4. Drive a little and give passports to a Nicaraguan offical. They checked our car right here in the road. \r\n5. Fumigation (pay later during Aduana proses) \r\n6. Get passport stamped. Building is obvious and on the left. Pay a $1 for entrada, then another $12 to guy who gives you your stamp and a piece of paper (do not loose, you'll need it to exit Nicaragua). \r\n7. Person in touristic office will ask for $5 (road tax, don't loose, keep with vehicle paperwork and you may be asked to present it to police) \r\n8. Find vehicle inspector, get a form to fill out and wait for the inspector to inspect your car, the inspector with sign the form. Take form to other side of parking lot (among the food vendors to have police stamp form, and they need copy of drivers license and vehicle registration ) Take stamped and signed form into Aduana desk which is in the room behind where you were stamped in. You also pay your Fumigation of $3-6 in the same room Aduana is. (Price is dependent of vehicle type). No charge for TIP.\r\n9. Buy insurance. Ours was $12. Insurance both is just past Fumigation window, but outside. \r\n10. Enter Nicaragua. Vehicle paperwork is checked. \r\n11. We have a dog, but rumor is on Sundays the bank is closed and they don't care about the dog since they can't take money for it. No one asked or said anything about our dog. Today is a Sunday. \r\n11.

When i asked how much it is, he said: just drink a beer or two at the bar and maybe have some food. So we did. We had delicious Nachos and cold beer at the beautiful giant patio. He offers Wifi and bathrooms (without showers) in the bar. The property is covered with small trails that lead through the jungle. We saw a toucan and sometimes you can even see up to Volcan Baru in Panama. We really liked it here! ",

Vehicles can be left parked outside their office in town on the side of the road. We felt safe doing so because it is such a small and remote community.  There's spring water for drinking but you need to bring your own food up to cook. Since it's such a unusual place I recommend checking out their website for more info www.Bolita.org.

Beautiful beaches, snorkling the reef with guild in boat 20-25 hr.  We talked to the owners when we arrived and the lady was welcoming to us.

The road is narrow and not for large vehicles    I only saw men On horses and some motorcycles   The road takes some time. But is very cool.  I talked to one guy that rents his house out. So maybe you can find a place.  There is no services on this road. You are alone  the road number is 904",

    "description": "Highly recommended!! Our camper van needed alternator work after driving from Alaska to Costa Rica, and was broken down in a parking lot. Manuel saved us like a doctor arriving at the scene of an acciden- step aside and let the pro go to work. He came with a large charger so we could have enough power to drive to his shop, which is super organized and professional. I trust him completely, he saved us, did excellent work rebuilding our alternator very quickly for a very fair price. We could tell right away that he is an expert with attention to detail and does not cut corners. His family is incredibly nice as well. He was super patient with our horrible Spanish. Highly recommended, thank you Manuel!!\n\nOffice phone +506 2440 1143 \n\nCell / what's app +506 6187 1048",

There really aren't any camp options in Santa Elena so we lucked out by asking Norman's help! Flat, quiet, cool campsite and right next to free walking trails into the cloud forest where we saw agoutis, opossums and a sloth!! About a mile to Santa Elena downtown. We walked in for groceries etc. but there are tiendas with limited stock closer by. Norman is super friendly and he also owns a Honda mechanic shop next door if you need any car/bike work done. We loved it here!",

People park here during the day as it is the best spot to enter the water and to ride Pavones. When I was there, at night, there was either nobody or a couple of tents.\nFor surfers: You're at the beginning of the point. To get into the water at high tide, walk a bit to the left of the beach to avoid the impact zone. At low tide, to avoid the rocks, walk all the way left, next to big rock into the water.\nAnd the morning, you can be the first one to be in the water, as everybody has to walk or drive to come here.\nThis is a dream spot for me.\nEnjoy!\nRafa \u0026 Dino",

Once he starts talking, make sure you have a beer around 'cause it'll take a while :)\r\n\r\nThis beach is one of the - if not THE - best turtle spotting beaches in the world. Every might they can be spotted, ranging from a just a couple to thousands of them.\r\n\r\nHe knows when and where to go spot them. Normally you have to take a guide, but you can just walk out of the camp ground onto the beach and start looking for them. Walk along the water line and look for belly dragging marks. You're not allowed to use white light, only red light.\r\n\r\nThe amount of turtles you'll see is highly depending on the moon so if you have time, I'd contact Gilbert (NV below) and ask when is the best moment.\r\nTwo options: go North (to the right) and walk about 300m, or go South. South there are more, but there's also a river with crocodiles, so not recommended to do on your own.\r\n\r\nThe camp ground itself is basic: no designated spots with light or electricity but lots of shade and a sheltered area with light and running water.\r\nPrice is 10USD pp, non negotiable. \r\nThe entrance is a big white and brown metal gate, with a yellow arch. All rigs can fit in.\r\n\r\nOwner is very friendly. You can contact him on +506 6123 9003 or via Facebook: Gilbert Rojas Araya\r\nUPDATE 10/JAN/17: Now 10$ pp to camp. No negotiating .",

    "description": "if you'd like to take a little 4x4 track through forest and beach, leave Road 160 at the location of the marker and follow this one-lane track south. It crosses a river (quite shallow in dry season) and heads towards the beach through the forest, where you can see monkeys from time to time. The track then continues for about 2.5km directly on the beach - I suppose this is only possible at low tide. Along the way you'll find several openings in the forest that you can access for boondocking, one is also on iOverlander. Later the track returns to land, goes through Manzanillo and then you can follow it further along the coast line to Hermosa - again with several spots for boondocking. The track isn't difficult at all, it's just lovely,  but because of the part on the beach I'd say it's 4WD - only. But I guess someone will prove me wrong and do it with his Chevy van :-)  ",

During the rainy season, the road is 4*4 only, we drove Toyota 4Runner and were fine. \r\nCloudbridge is a private nature reserve, and I believe, it's the only place in Costa Rica with entrance by donation, that 100% of incomes go back into the running and reforestation of the reserve, education of local and international students, conservation of primary forest habitats and studying the local flora, fauna and impacts of the reforestation efforts within the reserve.\r\nThere are amazing views and waterfalls, really no one was there during our visit, only one volunteer, who works at the Main Station and can provide you info about trails and animals. Suggested donation is 6USD, but you can go for free if you want to. There are free walking poles, which I highly recommend to use. If you like, you can swim in the waterfall, but it's really cold. There are also bathrooms in the parking lot and pit toilet in the middle of the trail.\r\nTo sum up, it is our favorite hiking place in Costa Rica.",

The place is on the left side about 150m along the road as you take the right fork as you enter the main part of Dos Brazos (ie at the school and pulpería). If you get to the first segmented concrete bridge, you've gone too far, the place is immediately before this bridge. I included a picture of the house from the entrance. \r\n\r\nLigia offers camping and parking with an out-building that has a toilet and showers (it used to be the El Tigre pulpería).  Ligia and her husband Wilner are both very friendly and welcoming. They have a dog, Tigre, who is very relaxed. \r\n\r\nThe house is right next to the first entrance to the El Tigre trailer, which is a 7ish hour loop that passes through Corcodavo park. You need permission and payment (you probably can't do this in Dos Brazos) to actually enter the park (although this is likely not checked) and perhaps a guide - but you can walk for perhaps an hour and a half up the trail without entering the park and have the chance to see the same animals. You can do the same from the other trail entrance (it's a loop) which is perhaps 10 minutes down the road right before a small blue building (with a sign mentioning the El Tigre park). \r\n\r\nThere is a fairly fancy tourist information building as well, if you take the left fork on coming into town, although we couldn't find the staff member when we stopped by (but they are apparently there all day). Lots of tours on offer. \r\n\r\nLigias yard has room for several vehicles, although only some spots are flat. Shade is available, but maybe not easily for taller vehicles. \r\n\r\nPrices are negotiable as of this moment, expect to pay between 2000 and 5000 depending on what services you want. I highly recommend a stop in Dos Brazos.  \r\n",

They also have bikes and buggy for rent. You can also do your laundry (5 USD per full load with drying) and order delicious breakfast (5 USD per person). Other meals might be available as well. The price is: 8 USD (NOW $10) per person and kids below 12 yo are free. Really recommended! It's totally worth it for these facilities!\r\n\r\nedit:   Price for large campers is $10 USD.

Lots of hiking trails close by, may also be a good option for parking if you plan to hike Chirripo. The rescue is always in need of good volunteers for dog walks and chores around the house. You can stay without volunteering but the dogs are so cute I doubt you’ll want to. I stayed 2 weeks and loved my time here! Watching the dogs and puppies change and grow is priceless. I also travel with a dog and having him with me was no problem (dogs must be good with other dogs and cats). Price: $10.00/night.

If someone asks you to pay to enter either negetiote the entrance price or say you came with the group. No one asked us anything the 2 mornings we came here. There are few places where to boondock around here, mostly gravel parking lots including one for big rigs such as unimogs 0.5km down the road from here. BThere is a brilliant hike to a waterfall 1.5km south of here on the left which goes for 2km through an amazing forrest with slippery ladders (most of which are missing stairs) and a hanging bridge. A bit demanding specially if it rained but we managed with kids of 2\u00264yo.",

Boat ride there takes 1h from Laguna las Perlas and August arranges dinner, breakfast and lunch only thing you need to bring is water, drinks, sunscreen, flashlight, bathing suit and bug spray.\r\n\r\nWe shared the island with August and 3 'caretakers'. Hawksbill turtles lay their nests there and all the nests are marked with date by a wildlife preservation society. Unfortunately we arrived 20min late to see the hatchlings of one nest crawl to the sea becuase August got the urge to fish just before arriving to the island.\r\n\r\nRain water tank for cooking and well with very little salt available for bucket shower.\r\n\r\nCalala Island you can stay in a fancy resort for 1900usd/night according to online booking platforms.\r\n\r\nWe got to snorkel on Baboon and Wild Cane Cay. Was not special.\r\n\r\nYou can reach August on +505 8635 1960. He is not honest and comes up with different excuses which we did proof to be wrong. For example why need to go back to Laguna las Perlas early....\r\n\r\nAugusto promised that he will be the captain taking us on the island. The moment we got to the port he said his wife has a medical emergency with a family member and his friend George will take us. 3 minutes later it was him again who will take us because it turned out that George was high on cocaine with the pay he got from August for the morning boat ride to the Cays. He hired the first guy he found in the port area who was too drunk to word out his name. August did not know his name but pretended he is trying to recall it. Next morning when he was sober but hangover he turned put to be a nice guy. (nicer the August)\r\n\r\nFuel to go back and forth is about 120usd and we paid in total 200usd for two persons.\r\n\r\nIt seems that camping on Crawl Cay organised by Queen Lobster is a better experience. https://innicanow.com/2018/06/15/pearl-cays-camping-nicaragua/",

So we decided to go further to see what we have at the end of the road, and we found this big resort. There are 2 parking lots, one of the resort and another one free for people who wants to go to the beach (we stayed at this one). For our surprise the wifi of the resort reached our car and it's open and fast! So we could stay for free with wifi! Plus they have toilets in a bar for free for everyone too! It's an excellent place to stay! The beach was amazing too!!! It's a paradise! The wifi works only in certain spots, you can pick water in the toilets, no to fill a tank, just bottles.",

Midweek is busier with guests (seems like office workers quite like it here and they are always quiet) so might be worth just calling ahead to ok space in car park.\r\n- Safe and secure (gate locked at night)\r\n- Various water points around the car park easily accessible.

Everything very well maintained (western style) and was a welcome stay after crossing from Panama at Rio Sereno. Paid 26000 colones for a double room without breakfast. Quite a few eating places in town and a good supermarket 100m away.",

No wifi. The access is through a wooden port with yellow letters \"GANADERAE Volcan. Open it and follow the 600m unpaved road through the flowers to both sides. Vehicles with very low clearance could have difficulties since the road is a bit bumpy but going slowly you should be fine. There are three dogs, three donkeys, and 9 goats.

We saw 1 female and 2 male quezales but the crowd of people scared them away quickly. Around 7:30 am we returned to Hospedaje Monge and just where the track to the waterfall starts was a male quezal in the tree. We had a really nice view at it for a long time before it flew away. There are tour groups coming to Hospedaje Monge as well, so it’s easy to follow them and find the birds. It was nice to see the Quezales but I think a tour with 30-35$ p. P. is way to much. We are happy we saw the birds for free. Normally Hospedaje Monge / Rancho Las Islas charges $6 per person to see the quetzales and do the waterfall trail, but because we camped there it was free for us.",

There is an elementary school, a church and a soccer field. At 200m are the thermal springs Eco Termales Quepos located. Here is also a restaurant where you can order typical Costa Rican casados. \r\n\r\nCalathea Lodge has two lodges and a camp site. As we are located next to the river of Dos Bocas you'll fall asleep with the sound of the water. Singing birds will wake you up in the morning. \r\n\r\nThe camp site is suitable for one tent or one car with rooftop tent. There is a private terrace with a sink and there is a private bathroom. $15 per night, cash only.\r\n\r\nWe opened a small shop (a pulpería) next to the lodge with basic groceries, soda drinks and ice creams. You can find us here during the day, it's the small building with the green roof.\r\n\r\nDO NOT USE GOOGLE MAPS to get to Dos Bocas. Google Maps doesn't know the best route. Go to Hatillo (a bit north of Dominical), in Hatillo look for the soda La Unica, turn into the road across the soda. It is about 20 / 30 minutes from here, it is best to drive a 4x4.\r\n\r\nWe would love to welcome you. We speak English, Spanish and Dutch. Please send us a message if you would like to stay the night so we can make sure everything will be ready when you arrive. Reservations for one of the lodges we would like to receive at least one day ahead. Check in is between 1PM and 6PM, check out before 10AM. \r\nWhatsapp only +506 8708 6929 (Spanish)\r\nWhatsapp only +506 7058 6525 (Spanish, English, Dutch).\r\nThere is no cell service after Hatillo.\r\n\r\nPura vida,\r\n\r\nEliseo \u0026 Anouk\r\nCalathea Lodge",

Raw wild riverside camping.

Look out for the warm water rock pool I made for bathing in. \r\n\r\nTo get here you’ll need to ford across one and sometimes two rivers making it exciting to get to. Occasional locals further upstream playing on the tree swing or paddling in the river. \r\n\r\nFlat ground but needs a 4x4. Other vehicles could park down river nearer to the weir but less secluded. The only place I stayed for two days. Not ready to leave but must continue my adventure. Enjoy ;) x",

Also opposite on the other side of the road is a big open free spot which is really nice. Some kind of restaurant on site, but not sure if it’s open as we didn’t need it. ",

    "description": "On the river bank of RIO COTOS next to BAR EL TURISTA. \r\nSuper nice and flat. Some action from people crossing the river to go the next town (Naranjo). The river can only be crossed in summer, so they take advantage of that. The river was only about 1 foot deep but if it rains it can get impassible. You don’t need to cross the river if you just camp next to the bar or along that side of the river. \r\nThere is a big shaded tree next to the bar, but if you drive alone the river you can find other good spots (4x4 required if you adventure a bit further along the river). \r\nWe stayed here 2 nights (on the weekend) at the end of March (which is the end of dry season) and it was very peaceful. Lots of birds at sunrise and sunset. \r\nGreat spot. Super safe. And we got to swim in the warm river all day. \r\nTo get here you likely need to drive about 10km in the palm field on a dirt road. It’s well maintain and was not a big deal with our truck camper. It’s a bit bumpy at the beginning, but got better after the first 3km. You do have to cross several pretty narrow bridges, but they are the same buses, semis, and tractors with huge loads of palm oil fruits cross. So I would not worry about the weight. It felt 100% ok for us as we saw many other much larger and heavier vehicles cross it. \r\nThe bar used to serve food several years ago. They might still do. They also have toilets you can probably rent for a small fee or just if you buy a drink or something ;). Super nice local people. ",

Problem was our UK vehicle registration states it is not proof of ownership. Eventually, with help of a fixer and a letter from a local agent requesting a 24 hour pass through the country we managed to meet with 'administration ' and persuade him that the truck was BFF ours and he gave us the full 60 day pass! Be very careful, they confiscate at least 1 car a week ( but these usually have Guatemalan or Salvador plates). I recommend using a fixer here, ours caught up with us on his motor bike, he asked $20 and I gave him $40 as without him it would have cost $600 to be escorted back to Mexico and another 90 days before we could  get back into Guatemala.

The nice lady in the tienda at the top of the K61 road on the highway owns this restaurant as well. Ask her for permission to park your rig here as this is a gated area. We paid $5 for the night. The land between K61 and K59 is private with several armed guards patrolling the fence all day and night. I chatted with them; very nice. There is a public pool right on the ocean side of the fence that the guard, Luis, said we could use safely any time. He said it is safe here, very tranquilo. It can get busy on weekends so best to visit during the week.",

From the park entrance you need to drive 20km up a dirt cobblestone road to the scientific station where park rangers are stationed. Parque Nacional Montecristo is a beautiful park with different micro climates and gorgeous hikes. You need to make reservations online by going to marn.gob.sv and downloading and filling out a permit request form and emailing  to Cristina Ardon at ardon@marn.gob.sv to get your permit approved. (I'm adding the form we used for your rederence). Make sure you write down the exact days you'd plan to stat in the park. Beware that prices are per day basis. $6 per person per day (foreigners) $1 per small vehicle. If you are camping one night you'll be charge for the day you enter the park AND the following day, even if your are leaving early in the morning. Campground #2 has potable water, showers, flush toilets, BBQ pits, tent pads and tables. There are several beautiful hikes and the campgrounds are very nicely set up.

All there is is a shack with chairs, tables and a few hammocks. no facilities except for a simple manual flush toilet behind a curtain. for $5 a night, if you have your own cooking and don't mind using the ocean as your facilities it is perfect. quite at night, cattle gate if it makes you feel more secure. The owner Valentino runs a little cantina on the entrance to the road, nice, friendly fella.  The spot is grassy and relatively flat with a few trees, certainly not for big rigs.",

Of course, we did, so we gave up two cameras, my wallet, a bag full of our clothes and our cellphone. At some point he pointed his arme directly on the head of my girlfriend and he started counting...

The other rooms are more spacious with bigger kitchens but are 35 or 45 USD per night. There's a nice tree-shaded central courtyard with several tables and chairs to hang out in. Wifi works in the courtyard but not in our room. Hot shower, 2 blocks from the central square. Very nice staff. Highly recommended if you can get the one budget cheaper room! Seems most rooms in town are 30+ USD. We looked around at several other places and this was by far the best for the price.",

Santiago the owner was really nice to us. He even offered me to look at the hotel further down if it was better for us. Which we did but they would charge 40 usd. The other ioverlander spot suggested next door had dirty pools. Highly recommended with kids as the beach is close by and pools are clean and refreshing. Very quiet at night, no dogs and no noise from the road.👍",

All 3 hikes must have a guide. The two crater hikes also take armed police escorts for security.\r\na) a short 45min circular trail. Can go anytime. Trail is free, pay guide a tip (suggested $1).\r\nb) Izalco crater hike. 5hrs. Guide said it is steep \u0026 challenging. Rarely goes on weekdays unless pre-booked for a group. Demand is low due to the challenge but there's usually enough people at the weekends. Price $6 pp (foreigners) for trail in a special volcano zone, + $1 pp for guide. Leaves only at 11:00 hrs (no other times).\r\nc) Santa Ana crater hike. 4 hrs. Goes everyday (except rarely if less than 4 people turn up). Bit steep in parts but not too challenging. Leaves only at 11.00hrs. Must leave the crater rim at 13:00hrs to come down. If you are slow going up, you may have very little time at the top. This hike leaves from the main park (here) but the first section is steep downhill to Hotel Tibet.  You can intercept and join the hike either at Hotel Tibet at around 11:10 (you can park here for $2) or at the Santa Ana entry point at around 11:20 (see on maps.me and iOv - this is good if you are camping at Casa Cristal). There are 2 benefits with these 'shortcuts': (i) you don't pay the park entry fee to get to the start point; and (ii) you don't have to walk all the way back up the steep hill to the start-point to get your car afterwards. Hike price is $6+$1pp. \r\nWe did the Santa Ana hike from the start point and really regretted not having joined them at Hotel Tibet instead. By going to the start you pay the extra park entrance money just to do a tiring and boring section of the hike (walking back up at the end was hell!! 😐). Other than that, it's a great hike, spectacular views and highly recommended.\r\n",

    "description": "We were told this is the only insurance company in El Salvador allowed to insure foreign vehicles. When we entered from Honduras we could not get insurance at the border so we came here. Very nice \u0026 helpful staff but after an hour of form-filling and questions, they could only offer us cover for a year at $800!!!. Cover was for most of Central America (incl Mexico but not Belize) for our UK reg'd Iveco Daily 4x4 (2014). They said if we don't use a full year we can cancel and get a refund on the balance, but we didn't take it. Too expensive for us.  But if you are desperate, you might be able to negotiate a better deal, esp if you have a smaller or older vehicle. The cover levels were quite high, so maybe a better price could be negotiated for lower cover.",

    "description": "La Fabrica is one of the more mellow and tranquil spots in El Tunco. This is my 4th time staying at this location in the past 2 years and I can't get enough of it- I've stayed at 3 other hotels/hostels in town and this is by far my favorite. The entrance to the property is just outside of the main gate to El Tunco. The family that manages the property is very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. \r\nThere are several hostel rooms (with fans), a few hotel rooms, a shared kitchen and common area, and a pool. The bathrooms and showers are pretty clean. \r\nLa Bocana surf break is located directly out the back gate. The property is completely enclosed and the gates remian closed during the day and are locked at night- very safe and secure. Laundry service, gallons of drinking water, and beers are available onsite. \r\nRV parking is available for a very reasonable price, we are paying $4 per person per night to stay for a week. I believe the single hostel rooms are $10/night and a double room \r\nis $15/night. \r\nWiFi is a bit slow but is fast enough to browse the web and make WiFi calls when in the common area. \r\nOverall a really great place to stay.",

There are shared bathrooms, grilling area, wood-fired oven, picnic area, playground, a bunch of animals, etc. They welcome dogs/pets (plenty of space) and kids (this is a really great spot to spend some time as a family!). Tobias and Yazmin can provide information about some great walks in the beautiful area and going up to Pital, or take you if you like! Note: there's a small bolted sport climbing area up at Pital too, Tobias knows the way. They can provide breakfast/lunch/dinner if you want, the pizzas are delicious. \r\n--\u003e You NEED a 4x4 to go down to this place. They have parking space for one or two cars/vans, but it's not level and thus not really suitable to sleep in your vehicle. If you don't have a 4x4, there's a safe parking possibility in the village (about 10 min walk from the cabins) and Tobias can pick you up.\r\n--\u003e Best to text/call upfront, the place isn't easy to find without directions: 50370246928",

Lured to the town on the promise of security, the citizens were separated into groups with the men locked in the church, and women and both girls and boys in nearby houses.  The next day the torture and killing began, men first, then the older women.  Young children were last.  Only one person escaped to tell the tale of what happened that day.  Others had fled before the invasion to the surrounding area east of Rio Sapo and therefore survived as well.\r\n\r\nToday there is a memorial in the village commemmorating the names and ages of those who lost their lives in El Mozote, Guacamaya and the other hamlets.\r\n\r\nWe were greeted upon arrival by a woman who told us the history of the event.  A small display shows photographs of the aftermath (not suitable for children), and there are books and CDs (in Spanish) you can purchase, along with handicrafts -- the money goes to help the ongoing effort to educate visitors about the tragic happenings (or you can make a contribution).\r\n\r\nThis makes a nice companion stop to the Museum of the Revolution in nearby Perquin.

The rocks are hex shaped columns that form from an old volcano.  Really interesting to see and climb on (when there is no water).  Probably even more interesting with water!\r\n\r\nYou can drive there and park...probably limited to 24ft long due to difficulties in turning around.  Even though we could fit, we took a tuk-tuk for $5 for 15 min wait and return.",

He also plans to ride a motorcycle down the Pan American. It’s a great location, tucked away around the back of the farm in a grassy area up in a hill. The farm recently opened a cafe selling coffee (to drink, maybe beans too), cheese, milk and honey (all farm produced) as well as having young cow feeding times for kids and things like sugar cane crushing. \r\n\r\nThe bus to and from Juayúa is just 20c and you can catch it outside the farm or head 5 mins up the road to the small town of San Jose de Mojada and catch it from there.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to have Overlanders stay, he let us use the toilet and shower in the guest building and there is water available too if you need a tank fill (likely clean but not potable). They have electricity you can use but not at the site. You have the choice if where to stay in the fields, we chose the back corner as recommended by him. Some tight-ish corners through the farm but we were in easy enough in a long bed full ton Dodge Ram 3500 + camper. No height clearance issues.\r\n\r\nWe planned to stay a night and stayed two. Felt very welcome and secure, quiet too. The farm is also guarded at night. Expect an enthusiastic welcome from a pack of dachshunds and you may, like us, spot a quetzal in the trees nearby. A great stop for kids and adults alike. Check out the pictures for a better idea).\r\n\r\nWe were not charged. I am not sure this will continue forever, who knows. We purchased some cheese and milk etc. Alvaro seems to love travel more than profit :)\r\n\r\nRight next to a cell tower for full bars 3G Tigo (10 Mbs)and full bars LTE Claro (41Mbs ... yes, forty one!). Tested by Ookla. \r\n\r\nHappy to be adding this first, great friendly hosts. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nDirections: Just at the corner into / out of town you will see a bright red shed which is the cafe. The gate into the farm is just beside with two big tractor tires buried into the ground either side of the entrance. (See gate in pics)\r\n\r\nContact: probably best to contact first but they will likely be happy to accommodate you just turning up. Contact Alvaro on:\r\ndiazalvaro940@gmail.com\r\n+503 7860 4197",

It might be possible though, since the restaurant has restrooms; and there is a shower at the swimming pool.\r\n\r\nThere is a restaurant too. Food was greasy, nothing special and seemed kind of expensive (11$ for a share appetizer - big portion / 8$ to 11$ for a main / 2,5$ for beer and drinks) but it was our first restaurant in El Salavador so we have nothing to compare with.\r\n\r\nThere is a swimming pool, clean as it seems.

The bathroom in the cabaña is probably the nicest bathroom I've used in all of Central America.  Brenda also gave us 2 big bags of her coffee that she grows and roasts herself as well as offered to take us to the beach at the lake if the road was in good condition. It sadly was not that day so we didn't go. There is a large grassy area where you can pitch a tent with swings. The pupusas and yuca Frita at the restaurant are delicious. I didn't look at the price break down of my bill but for the food, two drinks and the camping for two people it was $24. She also said that there usually is wifi but the router wasn't working that day. ",

There are 3 lounge areas with hammocks, lounge chairs, BBQ and amazing views. Camping is 75Q per night (per v Aehicle). Call or email ahead as there are only 8 spaces for RV's.\r\n\r\nPierres phone number is: (+502) 7723 4055\r\n\r\nBEWARE: The road on the last 8 km has recently been paved with excellent asphalt and is no longer a trail. But it is steep and has several fairly tight switchbacks. Caution with camper more than 6 meters. Otherwise the campsite is beautifully located facing the lake and volcanoes. Travel time to this campground from Pan Am can now be done in an hour with new road surface.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nOwner wishes to declare the place pet friendly BUT then wants to give permission on a case by case basis. This obviously means that the campsite is NOT unconditionally pet friendly. But then aren’t all campsites allowed to decide whether they accept a pet or guest. Tthe public boats between Panajachel and San Marcos and vice versa stop at Pasaj Cap when asked. Very convenient when arriving on foot. ",

Several Mayan groups celebrating their religion - very authentic. It's like visiting a cathedral but the altar is a lake. From the waypoint, it's about one hour on foot to the Mirador over an uninteresting steep track also used by the shuttle service. From the Mirador there's a staircase down to the lake. They want you to take the 'nuevo sendero' back up (one way traffic because of the pandemic), but signage is unclear. Going back, walk left of the stairs until you find a trail going left (no sign). That is the nuevo sendero. We spent a few hours of mindful 'being there' (and meditating) . Paid GTQ 50 per person and GTQ 15 to park.",

It was possible to pay directly in USD. In addition they checked the fridge for fruits, vegetables, diary products and meat: Tomatoes, Peppers, citrus fruits, eggs, cheese and fresh meat are not allowed - as well as the import of beer?!? Wine, rum, apples, cucumbers were fine...  The whole process was absolutely friendly and professional and in English language.

We paid 25 GTQ pp to camp and sleep in our minivan and were also allowed to stay next to the river till the next morning before other people/customers arrive. Pets are allowed, but you have to clean up after them. There is plenty of places to park any size vehicle that you may have and tons of room to pitch a tent or even a covered area where they would allow you to hang a hammock. There is a snack shop on site with drinks, snacks and ice cream. They have many BBQ pits available to use and you can borrow a grill at the office area but you need to bring your own wood or you can just head into the bushes across the river and find some. The road in is dirt but is one of the smoothest dirt roads we have been on in a long time. There is one other site on the river that is one km before this location so make sure to not mistake this place for it. ",

If the property gate is closed call 55530825 and talk to the Rafael Guarcax to get access to the property and for information. You can buy/fish trout for 30 quetzales a pound and 15 quetzales a pound for carpe. There are different ways to get to the property. From Panajachel is about an hour and a half and a third of the route is through a dirt road that takes you through very pretty and small farming villages. You can also access the property from the CA1 / Panamericana which is shorter. There's still a section of dirty road. Bigger rigs and two wheel drive may be ok but road is narrow and steep in some spots. During the rainy season there might be sections with deep mud.",

Howler and spider monkeys, the elusive jaguar, quetzal, tigrillo, tapir and many other animals live in this park. You can hike the nearly virgin and astonishing cloud forest to an even more gorgeous rock called La Peña del Angel. This rock stands high above the middle of the forest for breathtaking views! The drive to the Scientific Research cabins is about 3+ hours up the mountain from the town of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. This offroad trail has a technical level of 3 - 5 depending on the season. During the rainy season it can be very challenging and recovery gear most likely will be needed. You'll encounter loose sand, gravel and rocks, muddy spots with deep ruts and narrow stretches with overgrown vegetation. ***4x4, high clearance and recovery gear is a must*** 8.5 ft height max due to overgrown vegetation. Patience is a must. A guide to drive up is a must. $15 (USD) to use cabins $10 (USD) for tent/car camping. You can contact Vince Broady at ‪+502 3000 9423‬ to obtain detailed information in English about the trail and the logistics (you still need an official guide to enter the park). The official guide and contact info is the following: Israel Albizures at +502-5046-0431 or email him at isratineco@gmail.com (spanish only) to arrange a guided visit to the park. You can also visit the web page DefensoresDeLaNaturaleza.gob.gt to obtain more information in english and have a guide assigned to you. You can alternatively visit the offices of Defensores de la Naturaleza in Guatemala City. ",

His property is in San Felipe right at the lake Izabal. Nice lush area with 2 houses. One the Vogel's are using if around  (said it's around 1 weekend per month) the second building stands on poles over the lake which has the kitchen, one or two bedrooms  (not sure as we slept in our rig), shower, bathroom and small wirlpool. Beautiful spot to sit in the open house to watch the sunrise.\r\n\r\nWe parked under coconut palms but there is also a grassy pit if you want sun. Dogs should be ok, as his local worker (Marios lives next door and is his general drudge) has 2. He has several boats and he or Marcos could take one out on the lake. There is plenty of space to hook up a hammock or pitch a tent. No clue what that would cost in the end. Kitchen is fully equipped. WiFi yet but if more people would come he would instantly get it ready. Shower is cold but nice refreshing, the lake in August warmer. Very nice to swim there.\r\n\r\nThe Fort of San Felipe is 5 minutes away by foot. Collectivos from there to Rio Dulce or to the Finca El Paraíso. There are also caves close by.\r\n\r\nIf someone is interested to stay on his property drop him a mail markus2002gt@gmail.com or call him 52020545. \r\nClarify what you want and negotiate with him. We loved to chill out on the couches and watch the lake.\r\n\r\nPrice: 40Q's PP and 50Q's for electricity per day.",

She charged us 60 qtzles total for two people and a dog.  There is a nice pool and good wifi that we were able to pick up from our car in the lot.  If the small outdoor room isn't rented then you can use the bathroom with the shower - which is really nice and clean with hot water.  If the room is rented you can only use the bathroom in the restaurant which has no shower.  There is an outdoor sink as well.  The restaurant doesn't open until 8 at night so we didn't try it but it seems popular with locals.  Only room for one or two rigs at a time.  There is a dog that lives here - they were fine with our dog, too, but said their dog doesn't always like other boy dogs (ours is female) A boy dog probably wouldn't stop you from camping here but she is cautious about that.  We didn't ask for a power hookup but I believe for a small extra fee she would let you run an extension cord.  The church next door was SUPER loud  for a couple of hours and...energetic...but we were more entertained by it than annoyed.    I think they have had other people camp here but we seemed to be their first rooftop tent people and everyone here was pretty fascinated by it.   ",

    "description": "This school offers 1 on 1 or 1 on 2 instruction, and is well worth the price. This school is owned by teachers who branched off another school and created their own.  All teachers speak some English, which we have found to be very important. They offer homestays. For us they seemed expensive at first but they are a huge help in continuing to learn the language once you have left class.  We started class knowing very little Spanish and after 4 weeks left being able to maintain a conversation. \r\n\r\nWe took classes for 4 weeks with Selvin and would both highly recommend him as a teacher.  He has a ton of experience was very organized with his material.  Just being a native speaker does not make you a good teacher.  I was obvious that Selvin put a lot of time and energy into how he teaches certain concepts and the language as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at the home of Julio and Vila (the house of the Black Sheep). We recommend asking for them specifically.  They were incredibly welcoming, friendly, fun and went out of their way to help us learn Spanish.  Vila is hilarious and jokes around a lot. Julio is an English teacher in the local schools. He is also very knowledgable about the history of the Mayan people and the area.  They have two very sweet boys who do a good job helping you with your Spanish. We truly felt like we were part of their family. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a place to stop and learn some Spanish we highly recommend this place.  Very friendly people and well trained teachers.",

Christian (the owner) helped us with a great volcano tour and his wife bakes the most delicious cookies. The fridge is well equipped with both local and international beers and the chef can prepare a decent meal. Well recommended for small to medium sized cars. Am sure he will even try to fit in bigger cars on his spacious parking space in the future.

Keep in mind, that Montericco Hawaii is the holiday-place for the rich people from Guatemala City, so nothing is cheap. Freddy speaks English and Katy is an excellent cook. The place is crowded on weekends, but not as loud as a saturday night in Mexico. If you have to leave the parkinglot for the weekend, you can find a place beside the dirt road.

(read below comment with the title “Place to avoid” to understand why)\n\n—-\n\nThe other hotels we visited on waterfront charged at least 60 USD; this one gave us a large double room (#5) with AC, bathroom, balcony, TV, view on the lake (the best TV...) for 150 Q (20USD)....\nProbably this price is impossible to get on high season (Q300+taxes written inside the room door...). \nHot shower didn't work but not necessary because the heat. \nFor AC they charge a little extra fee; we didn't use it : fan was enough for us. \nSure, this is not Hyatt but in relation with price...\nThey have also dorms for Q50/pers and many backpapers stay here. \nOur car was parked in the street at the entrance of hotel and we could monitor it from balcony. \nFlores seems pretty safe and \"parqueo\" are very very rare in the city.

They are a self sustained school quite isolated from Poptun ( 12 km of bumpy road but we were able to make it with a 24 ft RV)\nWe were looking for Spanish classes in a less turistic and crowded environment and we ended up here. The college did not have such a program but they paired my husband with a teacher for 3 hours a day (one on one). They didn't have set prices for the classes (we were the fist to ask for such a service) so they asked us to eat at the cantina and pay 30 Q per person per day for 3 meals (all lacto ovo vegetarian). They said we didn't have to pay the teacher but a propina and a donation for the college would be appreciated.  The Spanish teacher Leonel Lopez was amazing. We camped near his house ...sewage, water, electricity, and weak wifi available. Before coming here you should send an e-mail to ask for further information...because it is a religious school and you will have to abide by certain rules (wearing shorts, no loud music and party, no meat, no alcohol, etc). We spent 16 days here and overall, although we are not adventist, it was an great experience.(icap9t@gmail.com; phone: 31093251) \nNote there are no showers an bathrooms available, so you have to be self contained.",

We paid 160Q per night for 2 people including free parking. I think they were running a deal since it's a new property - my guess is it will be 225 or so once you read this post and the place gets more online reviews but still worth it!

Park your rig in the walled parking lot in back and have access to all facilities, including a nice covered patio overlooking mountains and villages, fast wifi, super clean bathrooms, and best of all, unlimited access to private steam saunas which are heated with steam from natural volcanic vents. There are 7 private saunas each could hold max 4 people. Cold shower in each sauna room so you can cool off then hop right back in. Absolutely amazing place and the staff are happy to have overlanders camping - you could probably pitch a tent in the lot in the back - just ask. Nice looking bar and restaurant on site too but we didn't eat there as we cooked on our stoves out back. We only found this place after getting deterred from camping at the springs which now costs 130Q per person, absolutely no negotiating with the gatekeeper. We skipped the hot springs altogether and don't regret it a bit. But if you want to see the springs, consider doing just the day and then sleeping at Las Cumbres. ",

We visited El Recreo because we could stay overnight on their parking lot which is not visible from the road. \nIf you long for a long, very hot bath in your own private, big bath tub, you should visit one of these places. \nEl Recreo is under reconstruction and it looks as something closed down and not attractive at all. \nThey are open though, and they have a few reconstructed private bath tub rooms on offer. Nice and clean. You pay 30 Q for the tub for one hour, and we had enough room for the whole family of 5. All the very hot and cold water you like  to use! As our giude book says: you could drown an elephant. We enjoyed it a lot!\nSaludable looks better from the outside. Small bar etc. Different tub sizes available, 20-30 Q. Also a common inside pool for 20 per adult, 10 per child. Bath rooms are a little less attractive looking since they are older and maybe less clean. \nYou can sleep on their parking for free, too. At least thats what the actual guard told us. You are very close to the road, though, and visible. ",

To Gua : 1. Checkpoint police a little before border. Checked TIA and called us in at aduana. 2. Drive to Aduana, or DGA, left side of the bridge crossing. They stamp and sign papers. You need a copy of your TIA, best get them prior as there a not a lot of copy shops. The Aduana copied it eventually for us. 3. Walk or drive down to Aduana building, give them the papers as stamped by the bridge. They keep the original. 4. Go to immigration E.S. And do passport. 5. Good to go, drive across the bridge and a little past it. You'll see the building, can't miss it. 6. Go to immigration and get passport stamped/checked. 7. Go to Aduana, give them the copy of your E.S. TIP from the guys at the bridge, your vehicle paperwork, license and passport. They fill out the forms and you need to pay taxes (105q per motor). This is in an opposing booth which opens the following hours: Mo-fr: 07:00-19:00 SA: 07:00-17:00 Sun: 08:00-17:00 Aduanas closed from 1-2 for lunch. ##!! You cannot cross if you don't pay so mind the hours!! ## Note: they don't accept dollars so best get quetzal prior to leaving E.S. or pay a bad exchange fee (1$ to 7Q we payed). Sign some form and wait a little. 8. You get a TIP and a sticker. You don't need to stick it, just be able to show it. 9. Good to go! Took us about an hour to get it all done. Good trip! \r\nUPDATE: now need to pay 160Q to enter guatemala. ",

    "description": "This place was a little bit out of our budget but it came highly recommended so we decided to go and make up for it later, we are oso glad we did. We paid 130Q/night for two, a private room with 2 single beds and shared bathroom. The room with a queen bed was $150Q. Our room was basic but we only slept there. They have shared dorm for 60Q/p. They have much nicer bungalows, some on the river or in the jungle for more $300-450Q/night I believe? Unfortunately all Food is extra, but really freaking good. The breakfast is 30-40Q/person and Lunch is around 45Q/meal, both from a menu. We brought snacks and ate only one meal other than dinner to save some money. The pizza for two for 65$ is the best bang for your buck at lunch. The dinner is 55Q/pp and is a family style meal. (You can ask to not have your meal with everyone) We can sometimes be antisocial but we really loved sitting down and getting to know everyone, the people and food were different every night. You never had to worry about not getting enough. The bread and chimmichurri that comes with dinner is worth it alone. Drinks are also extra. Alcohol was expensive but we smuggled in our own rum 😊. Drinking Water is 3Q for 1L. Out front of the hotel is the river where you can enjoy the sun on the a dock or have fun on the rope swing. Behind the hotel is thick jungle with hiking trails. They have kayak rentals and offered a variety of hiking and kayak tours. We did the hiking on our own, the trails are on maps.me so it was easy. Highly recommend checking out the tiger cave, bring a flashlight. We rented the kayaks for a day and went to Livingston (about 2.5hours) they offer a shuttle back so you don’t have to paddle back up river (for an extra cost, of course). They have a sauna and a hot shower for extra cost, it isn’t much. Cold showers are free 👍 they have a gym and a place to do you own laundry and hang it up, also free. We spent most of our days reading in the hammocks and just enjoying the beautiful scenery and peaceful setting - also for free! \n\nOne final note, the boat from Rio Dulce to Finca Tatin or anywhere on the river is rather expensive. We paid 125Q/p on the way there and 110Q/p on the way back. If I would try and only pay the 110 on the way there. Finca Tatin offers a shuttle for 90q/p but only if they have 6 people, email or call before your arrival and see if they have a boat coming. They have boats to Livingston twice a day so coming or going there is never a problem (not sure of price on that).\n\nUPDATE ON PRICES SEPT 2018: hotel and food prices are all still about the same. Boat to/from Rio Dulce is fixed at 125Qpp each way, whether you get off here or go all the way to Livingston.\n",

It’s a bit difficult to store the kayak at Pierre’s without a bit of extra help which we found. Got up for the sunrise and paddled back to Santa Cruz while stopping at Cafe du Mundo for breakfast!\r\n\r\nUpdate 2022: 600Q per day..",

    "description": "This drive is not for conventional RVs.   I boiled my brake fluid while going down this road.   I have a 5 speed automatic but the problem is that the grade is too steep to allow first gear alone to slow you down enough to make the snake-like hairpins, as brake utilization will be mandatory, particularly on the last stretch of the road into Panajachel.   I also carry an infrared \"gun thermometer\" to check the plates of the rotors.   An additional problem is on the steepest stretch of this road, there is no place to pull out and allow the rotors to cool.   My rotors were at around 500F when the fluid boiled and I lost all braking capability but luckily at a location at the very bottom of the hill when they completely went out.   A few minutes more the the damage would have been horrible.  What I do through Guatemala while descending extremely steep grades that the transmission with not slow enough is to stop every 5 minutes and check the rotor temps.   As they reach near 400F, I allow them to cool down into the 180F or so which takes normally 10-15 minutes.   Then I begin the descent again, stopping every 5 minutes and rest and cool again as I approach 400F.   A normal transmission will not slow you down enough to make the hair pin turns on such a steep grade.   So if you decide to take this road, proceed with caution.  (Note that the road down into San Marcos is ever steeper.)",

    "description": "The wrecker owner who had to tow me down this mountain says it is the steepest in all of Guatemala which could extend to all of Central America, as the elevation drops over 1000 Meters (3000') in about 7 Km (4 miles).    I would say this is not for conventional motor homes (not my Sprinter based 5 speed automatic) and perhaps best only for either very light campers or for the \"full camper\" rigs build on an army truck chassis.   At minimum you will need a standard shift with a super low gear, as 1st on the automatic simply will \"run away\" on this hill if you are a heavy camper.   Of course my rig is heavy with a full camper body and supplies on board.   \r\n\r\nYou choose your own margin for error on this drop but remember that the \"brake burn out lane\" is to go off the cliff.   So in case you need help, you can contact the only tow truck in the vacinity, listed below.  (At bare, bare minimum, I'd stop and cool the brakes at any opportunity, which you will find is only about 3 pull-outs with only a few feet off the road.)   \r\n\r\nOtherwise, no problem in a conventional vehicle.   As always, only periodically give the breaks a few pumps to slow you down and don't ride them.   I use an infrared thermometer wand and I stop and check my brakes around every 5 minutes on steep grades down.   Brake fluid boils around 500F if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nP.S.

He can give you a guide too or rent tents, sleeping bags anything basically... Only thing to bear in mind is that the area is high, so not many trees live there, and the few that do are cut by Valeriano or the other camp site owners for construction and fire wood. We know how terrible this is, they do not. So if you can bring with you already cooked food or raw stuff, torches and warm cloths so you do not need to burn the last pieces of the natural forest.

We just drove down to the side of the lake that we had easier access to. \r\n\r\nThe road isn't too bad - just a typical off-road CA track. Stunning views on the way down, especially at sunset. We meandered through this area and some access to the river is blocked as private property but we found this huge flat area by the lake. There's only a ranch to the side and a football pitch. Completely wild camping and no facilities - it's a nice quiet spot near the lake for a pleasant stop off, a little rubbish scattered around and the lake doesn't seem that inviting to take a dip or swim in. The river actually had a lot of white scummy pollution which was quite odd to see. \r\n\r\nWe wouldn't suggest going out your way to this spot but if you want a stop over away from the (sketchy) town near by then we'd recommend as remote, spacious and nice views.

After much discussion they let us off with 20q. This does not seem to be a scam. These are uniformed officers taking a toll fee, at a proper road barrier and you get a receipt for the money.",

You pay your entry fee at the main gate/military guard station and from there it is 2km drive to the site.  Beautiful pyramids and open plazas, with enough canopy to make it feel mysterious and special.  Lots of spider monkeys and howlers, and in am and evening, flocks of raucous parrots fly overhead.  We arrived 8:30 am and had the ruins to ourselves for two hours before anyone else showed up.  One of our favorite Mayan sites because of the vibe, if not the pyramids themselves, and we've seen most of the main ones in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala.",

    "description": "We found this place on a whim after turning left off the CA-9 toward the Puebla of La Estancia de la Virgen.  We took the main road through the town, making a small detour where the road was damaged.  Following a rough (but manageable in 2 wheel drive) dirt road we were hoping to find a nice, quiet and flat place to stay for the night.  WE DID!  About 400m from the fork in the road that will take you to the iOverlander spot of Hotel El Olvido there is a large, relatively flat pull off on the left hand side of the road.  You can't miss it.  It looks like the locals use it for a quarry for gravel, because a large part of the mountain has been dug away here. There is a large telephone poll on the top of it. The wind was a nice reprieve from the heat and we had a nice view of the moon rise and the lights of the villages below us.  The road got more traffic than we expected. Several locals drove by in trucks or on motorbikes (and horseback!), but no one stopped by and - more importantly - no one bothered us.  At 7am some cops came by to ask if we were ok, if we needed assistance or if we were bothered.  We said no, that we were fine and that we'd be moving on that morning anyway.  They gave us their card and said if we had any trouble we could give them a call.  4056-4116. The cops in Guatemala and Mexico continue to amaze us!  Be aware, you are in bug country. It was crazy in the morning when we woke up (fine at night with the wind). Make sure you're wearing protection! Big rigs should be fine at the site, but may have trouble squeezing through the town's narrow roads.  No generators please, let's keep this place peaceful.  Of course there is ROOM for tents, but use your discretion.  We were fine, but a tent seems more vulnerable.",

We didn't eat, so we can't comment on the quality of the food. The mojitos were small (like the size of a rum and coke you'd get in an American joint) but boozy!

Parking is a very basic gravel lot (would fit 3-4 rigs with leaving enough space for guests). Price is 30Q per night which is by far the cheapest in town we could find. Dogs are very welcome, they have 3 of their own. Bathrooms, cold (but nice!) shower, awesome pool and chill out area can be used. It also has a restaurant, El Tiburon, that does really good but slightly expensive food. We did eat here a lot though as we saved so much on camping and it was very convenient. There is free coffee in the morning, the beach is a stone throw away and everybody is lovely! We really enjoyed our experience and only left after 4 days as the surf was too big for me. For us definitely the best place in town. Quiet at night if dogs are not barking!\r\n\r\nWe didnt need electricity but there seem to be a possibility to plug in with an extension\r\ncord.

Getting to the first check point I stopped and one guy approached us but never saw him again as I told him I didn’t need help.\r\n\r\nI went to the guys in the little booth and asked them if they could cancel my TIP. They thoroughly checked if I really wanted to cancel or if I wanted to return, seemed like they really cared. Some of this was with Google Translate since my Spanish is minimalistic and their English non-existent, again they put effort in helping. We needed two copies, which we could make across the street for 1QT per side (two pages double sides = 4QT).\r\n\r\nChecked VIN, stamped, had a nice chat (hence; I practised my Spanish) and we drove on.\r\n\r\nAbout 2km down the road there’s a bigger building, Guatemala and Honduras are together in one office here, worked out well.\r\n\r\nBut as we got closer there was a gate, two guys in what seemed a uniform and many around them (including the ones operating the gate) without. I didn’t trust them as they asked for papers and they didn’t open the gate, I reversed.\r\n\r\nThe one guy who asked me for papers followed me and I “explained” that I just wanted to pass through and wanted to do the paperwork inside. Now out of a sudden the gate could be opened (operated by non-officials going off their uniform).\r\n\r\nWe were asked by a “helper” (who spoke decent English) if we really didn’t want help and we kindly declined his offer. At least he was straight forward and pushy.\r\n\r\nPark behind the gate, went inside, got stamped out of Guatemala and stamped into Honduras at the cost of $3 paid in American cash. (Local currency would also have been possible.)\r\n\r\nNext the TIP, which was done by the guy who I didn’t trust outside and I apologised for my behaviour and explained the situation was confusing.\r\n\r\nHe collected copies, and started filling out paperwork. Somewhere along the line he mentioned we had to pay $35 per bank, but the bank was closed (since it was night time) and I needed to transfer online. I said no problem since I have internet (Google Fi) and asked where I should send the money to. He said it can only be done with a local bank and he wasn’t  able to accept cash.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy who he introduced (local) and he could transfer the money for me and I pay him in USD cash. I accepted without asking his commission. All the paperwork done, stamped and signed, I asked his commission.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Google Translate he said $50, I refused. Then he said $15, I refused again. He tried to explain it was his “work” and I told him it wasn’t an acceptable percentage.\r\n\r\nWith the paperwork done, now out of a sudden it was possible to pay the guy in cash, who we paid $35 and all was done.\r\n\r\nSo be careful, they tried to rip us off working together, luckily didn’t work.\r\n\r\nThe Guatemala officer checked VIN, collected the sticker from the windscreen, stamped two copies and off we went.",

Since we’re sleeping in the truck she didn’t charge us anything extra. The road up to the cenotes are rocky so a bit of clearance or cautious driving would be best. It was dry when we came but it looks like it could get messy during wet season. \r\n\r\nCamping/parking at the 2nd cenote only.

    "date_verified": "2019-09-25T00:00:00.000Z",
    "description": "We shipped our van in a 20’ container from Guatemala to Cartagena. We have a RDH van (Delica), so this seemed like the best option for us on our way south. This point is the office. 3rd story, gray building above a little pollo restaurant. The contact we went through was Mayden de Ralda. Her WhatsApp number is +502 5698 0994 (normally very quick to respond) and email is maydenderalda@corporacionmenorha.com. Although we got in touch a month in advance, she didn’t need confirmation of what ship we wanted until a week prior to sailing. The correspondence was easy- we sent via WhatsApp a copy of the vehicle title, the TIP, and passports. She sent the schedule for the following 4 weeks, a shipping quote for Seaboard, and the agency quote for themselves. The shipping cost $1003, and agency/port fees $525, so $1528 USD total on the Guatemala side. Our ship was to sail on a Wednesday, so Monday morning we arrived to begin the process, which went as follows.\r\n1. Had everything we wanted to travel with packed up. Once the vehicle is in the port they don’t let you get anything out of it. \r\n2. Arrived at their office (opens at 8:30) wearing long pants and close toed shoes (hiking shoes worked, but with smaller thin shoes they won’t let you in). Met Mayden and she sent us with Ricardo to take the van to the port, just a block away. We left our bags in the office. \r\n3. Took with us our passports, TIP, TIP sticker, and copy of drivers license (can leave it all in the van, it stays with you for a while).\r\n4. Ricardo gave us safety gear to wear and we began the rounds of stopping at several places to do lots of paperwork. He took care of all of it, only needing a few signatures. Because there were 2 of us, only the title holder can drive into the port, so the other person will ride on the back of Ricardo’s moto. There are a few stops to make (entrance, shipping booths, weighbridge, customs...)\r\n5. After all the paperwork and shuffling around was taken care of, we left the car in the “bodega” for the night. Ricardo gave us rides back one by one to the entrance where we turned our badges in, got our passports back, and walked 1 block back to the office.\r\n6. Back at the office, we made our payment to Mayden in cash (4069q). There was some confusion as to how to pay Seaboard, because you don’t do that through Mayden, nor the Seaboard office there. However, you have the option of paying that fee at the destination, which is apparently what most people do, and we will too (in Cartagena). The other option is to have with you the thousand dollars cash or thousand dollars worth of Quetzales in cash to deposit into the seaboard bank account. (I’ll report back how the payment goes on the Colombia side.)\r\n7. I’ll just note, all of this took most of the day. We had a couple minor hiccups, so, efficiently, it could probably be done in a morning.\r\n8. Done for the day, all that was left was to wait to hear from Mayden about what time slot we would get to put the van in the container for the following day. We stayed at a hotel just 5 min walk from the office.\r\n9. We got the 8am slot, so we showed up at about 7:40 to the office and again went to the port with Ricardo to put the van into the awaiting container. The port workers drove it in, strapped it down, and locked it up. Took photos of the container number and seal number. This took less than an hour.\r\n10. Back at the office, we got the final paperwork to take to Colombia, caught a taxi to the Litegua bus station in Puerto Barrios, and got a bus back to the city to catch our flight.\r\n\r\nOverall, there’s nothing to stress about. The only thing I wish I would have known before was that the process takes 2 days. We ALMOST bought flights for Tuesday, but figured we wait a day “in case anything comes up with the shipping.” Good call. Also, Mayden is super nice, she even bought us a big bag of fruit for our bus ride, and Ricardo was an absolute legend flying around the port taking care of everything. Highly recommend shipping with them.\r\n",

A dining and seating area outside, which is cosy. Definitely would stay here again!! Short walk to the city centre! Breakfast included. ",

I think it was 200Q/night with A/C. \r\nSpotless clean but beware of the ants if you let some food in your room. \r\nEach room has a little terrace with table and/or hammock facing the full-of-birds-and-plants patio.\r\nFast WiFi available everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe game changer for us: the hotel has a little gated parking for 4 cars just in front of the entrance. We could park our van (2,50m high) there. The gate is closed at night and it feels really safe.\r\n\r\nRestaurant on site - count 40Q to 50Q for a main, 30 to 40Q for breakfast. They have really good smoothies too.\r\n\r\nTip: a “señor” comes every day to the restaurant to sell its banana bread and carrot cake. He is there in the morning and often back again around midday. The banana bread is an absolute delight. One whole bread is 30Q. Half a carrot cake is 20Q.\r\n\r\nThe hotel also organized our trip to Tikal. 125Qpp round trip to the site, with a guide onsite. You still have to add the 150Q pp for the reserve entrance. Outbound at 5.30pm, so you are quite alone onsite when you starts the tour.\r\n",

Catalino picked us up from the tourist police park and took us to his house in San Jose where we slept and had a home made dinner with his family, cooked by his wife.\r\nBefore trekking the Acatenango volcano,  ASOAVA offered us direct contact with the guides without an agency intermediating (we felt our money was going to who really deserves it). It was just me, my girlfriend and our dog Pancho trekking, with a guide just for us, not the typical excursion. Once again we were offered home made meals while in the volcano, they offered us jackets, gloves, hats, sleeping bags and a tent with an amazing view to the volcano. The trekking took us 4 hours to reach the campground on the first day. We spent the night watching a beautiful show of lava explosions right in front of us, cooking dinner and drinking hot chocolate around a fire pit. On the 2nd day we woke up at 4am to start a 1h30 trek to the top of the volcano to watch the sunrise while the fire explosions continue! Catalino told us the best way to contact him is trough WhatsApp and Facebook, so we’ll leave his number here \r\ntel: +502 55004707 \r\nHope you enjoy it like we did :) ",

He’s also building a fish pond in the beginning of January. Toilet and shower in the little farmhouse. Very quiet, secluded and secure with someone always onsite. In the morning you can clearly see the volcano, it’s very close!! And if you’re hiking the volcano, Rolando can get the bus for you. Rolando’s son Jason is a great cook and can make food for you. Good cell reception. 50 Quetzales per person, so worth it! \r\n\r\nTake little windy roads through the small town, down the dirt road past sugarcane and trees painted white.

Flush toilets and running water (nonpotable though!) No food or drinking water available on site. No WiFi, just spotty 3g. Gate is locked all day and Nicholas lives on the grounds. Felt extremely safe and welcomed. The morning after, a group of locals arrived for what seemed like a church service/gathering. Everyone was so nice. Pets are not allowed but he let us keep our husky in the car until everyone left. There’s one older female dog on the grounds but keeps to herself and is a good security system. Great stay for one night! ",

Once you've chosen, she'll take you to the local market, where she knows the vendors and take you around to buy the necessary ingredients. From there, you'll walk to her house (where this pin is placed) and start chopping! The cooking part lasts 3 hours including the meal. Her story is incredible and beautiful. She runs the class in English and Spanish. 275Q pp is well worth it, especially knowing the money goes back into supporting women in the community.\r\n\r\nAnita is a trained tour guide who started her own company thanks to her tourism experience. She helps support single mothers by providing jobs, running a local weaving co-op, and fundraising for scholarships for children of single mothers to be able to attend elementary through high school.\r\n\r\nTo get in touch with Anita and book the class:\r\n\r\nE-mail: mayankitchen88@gmail.com\r\nPhone: +502 5824 7440",

We were invited to have lunch at Carlos’ house with the hosts where his wife made a delicious spicy soup. The entire atmosphere of the area is magical. You should definitely come here. You can find the listing on Google or Airbnb (I’ve pasted it below too). It is a 45 minute drive to Semuc Champey.

It may be passable without during the dry season. Right now it’s still wet and feeling the remanence from Hurricane Iota \u0026 Eta. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 places you can park. The mirador, the 1st parking area and the 2nd parking area closer to the Laguna. Getting to the 2nd parking area is not advisable by the locals BC it’s steep and wet in some areas but we saw pick up trucks do it. We parked at the mirador to sleep (no charge) and drove down to the 1st parking area then walked down to the Laguna to take a boat ride to the cenotes and waterfall. We negotiated Q500 for 2 people and a dog for the boat ride. Beautiful and worth it! There are cabins/rooms in cabins available or tent camping on a flat area next to the Laguna as well. Not sure what the charge is. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t have 4x4, ask the guys at the turismo office if you can arrange for a ride down to the Laguna, we saw locals with pick up trucks full of people to drop off. Also- try to arrange to come during the week! Very crowded on the weekends.",

Look for a tiendita almost directly North of this gps spot. It’s next to the dirt road where you’ll turn. There’s a ranch house behind the tiendita. At the house the family will charge you to drive through their fincas. We were quoted Q30pp to drive through the fincas to access Crater Azul, Q100 for access + camping (for 2 people), negotiable. The family is very friendly and will answer any questions you have about Crater Azul. You’ll drive through several livestock gates that you’ll have to unlatch and re-latch as you pass. The road is a bit rutted out but we saw a local van make it. High clearance will be helpful, but not necessary. It looks like it’ll get muddy when it rains. Not suitable for big rigs due to the low tree branches and a narrow, wooden plank bridge. We came in a 2.5m tall Toyota Sequoia. Flat, shaded parking spaces, trash cans, a pit toilet (just a hole in the ground) with plastic sheet walls on 3 sides. You can make a fire for grilling; there’s wood around. Crater Azul is actually a spring (not a crater) with crystal clear water. It’s very pretty and good for swimming. It looks more beautiful when it’s clean, but after busy days there can be lots of trash around. It can get overcrowded on weekends and holidays, as boats of people also come from Sayaxche. Mostly National tourists. Recommend visiting during the week. Bring everything you need, including insect repellent. Claro signal unreliable/spotty. ",

It's in the jungle, with the fauna that comes with it (birds, mammals, insects).\r\n\r\nThe last stretch of track is not on Openstreet-, nor on Google- nor on Apple maps. Have your GPS guide you to an unpaved road that starts North in between the residential blocks in Las Pozas but then goes North-west. By the time you're close to the waypoint, look out for a track on your right (that is not on the map), with a white, bulletholed and completely faded sign. Follow it, take a left after you've opened (and closed) a barb wired fence. The track can be muddy and two wheel drivers left their vehicle just before the last water/mud pool.\r\n\r\nClaro LTE coverage.\r\n\r\nOriginal: We found this place looking for the aguateca ruins. It’s a small dirtroad on your right if your coming from Las Pozas. It has a big white sign in front if the road that says aguateca. It’s a beautiful awesome place with alot of mayan history. We camped right next to the river where we could hear the monkeys howl all day. The river is great for bathing and connecting with the local community. If you want to hike to aguateca it’s 100q for the guide and 20q per person to enter the ruins. For camping its 25q per person. And you can basically put you tent, van or hammock anywhere you want. Definitely a place that i would recommend if you want to experience jungle life!!",

Great stop on your way to El Mirador, or to be in a remote area and still go to the lake in a hot afternoon.\r\nSuzanne and Mario (+1 8327039005 in case you need English, whatsapp preffered) have built the Jungle school from the ground up over the last 30 years, bringing education to the remote areas and jungle around San Andres. They normally have around 350 kids coming to school here every day! As part of their expanding school, they started with follow up programs to enable the kids to grow into a better future when they finish school. They have a thriving wood carving business on site (Itza Wood), a jewelry workshop, artisanal products, and a pretty impressive hydroponics experiment site (where you can camp as well). \r\nThey're also looking to expand into tourism with a nice 6p cabana (on Airbnb), restaurant (delicious food!) and various camping options around the farm, all with pristine toilets. \r\nYou can camp next to their house and be close to the sites activities and wifi, or you can camp in the middle of the jungle in total solitude.  It's a 800 acre/320hectare beautiful farm with hiking trails, birding, organic gardens and a bee farm, sure there will be a spot for your rig.. ;) As they've been here for a long time, they can arrange all kinds of local guides, hikes, tours as well.",

We only stayed there because it was somewhat close to the border, we were exhausted from entering from Mexico and it has good reviews.\r\nIt is located in a sketchy and dumpy neighborhood. I know this is Central America but this neighborhood is extra shady. The food the hotel restaurant is overpriced rubbery meats. They charged us more than the price listed in the lobby. During heavy rain water came into the room underneath the door. They kept telling us to keep quiet even though we were just reading and chilling with no music or tv; and even though they put us in a room next the the street where dogs were barking nonstop. \r\nAfter we showered we used the towels to dry ourselves and used the wet towels to wipe up the water on the floor. It rained heavily and water got into the room. As we were leaving the manager berated us and told us we need to pay Q300 for the two towels. She claimed the towels were left unusable. We tried to reason with her but she became more angry. So finally we gave her Q300. This place is the worst. Don’t let the positive reviews fool you. ",

    "description": "Just adding this with the informal campsite symbol as we would have missed this. You can find other reviews by clicking on the hotel icon. It is pretty steep in price, we paid 200Q for two people and a child. But a lovely option if you want to hunt down those protected birds. We were able to camp next to the ranchito/palapa, grill under it and use the tables, electric points and water hose. Wifi was pretty good. The toilets are clean and well kept. We were with other overlanders, some of whom also parked in the carpark and pitched tents in the „tree house“. We participated in a night walk and one in the morning. Lots of orchids and species like frogs, salamanders, snakes, blue jays and of course the Quetzal, if you’re lucky. ",

You can see Volcano Atitlan on a clear day! It is possible to access the lake for swimming and relaxing, about a 20 minute walk. There are two dogs here, one is friendly and loves other dogs, and the other is chained when the caretakers are not present. The caretaker's name is Cheyo, he is a local Mayan who knows the area well and is very friendly and helpful. He also offers local coffee for sale and guided volcano hikes.

I'm not sure if you can camp in your van here,  as I don't have one I didn't ask,  but it seems suitable. you'll still be advised by the host to have 4x4 to get here,  although the road to get to this spot is generally better than the final stretch into semuc.

There are 3 rooms, but we asked for camping as there is grassy area which can take up to 3-4 small tents(check photos). There is a number to contact the owner right at the entrance as he lives near the center of the village(see photo).\r\n\r\nHe gave us a price of 30 quetzales for three people per night(2 adults and 1 kid). There's a toilet and cold shower both in good condition. \r\n\r\nThat's the cheapest we have found so far after being on the lake for almost 10 days. \r\n\r\nThis place is more for backpackers. Also a small car/van can enter here though. \r\n\r\nThe patio is clean and looks nice. As the owners rents the rooms for around 1200 quetzales per month they are occupied most of the time by travellers. There's a kitchen, but we haven't looked very much at it, though it seems dirty due to careless by people who rent the place. One of the guy renting here has a dog running around.\r\n\r\nOverall OK place to spend several days exploring the area. \r\n\r\nThe entrance gate does not have a locker. The owner said it is very quiet here, but we locked it around 10:00 pm with our own locker for more safety. During day there's a lot of tuk-tuks passing by as the road which is 100 m away from the hospedaje is the road which goes to the dock with the boats. After 9 pm it gets really calm and quiet. \r\n\r\nSome of the neighbors do not speak Spanish, only Kaq'chikel so if there is no one around you can ask them to contact owner if you do not own guatemalan number. This was our case. \r\n\r\nHappy travels. ",

Two adults/one child.\r\n\r\nThere is a clean toilet and shower. We didn't ask for the shower as we said during negotiation that we wouldn't use the hot shower as it was very cold. Maybe with hot shower price could go up.\r\n\r\nThey also serve food during weekends and during the night some people came over to eat. Also they rent two rooms, I think in quite good condition. From outside looked clean. Where people eat there is a stove though we didn't ask to use it. \r\n\r\nOverall calm place to spend one night before trekking. \r\n\r\nThe entrance point for the hiking is really close to the place, maybe 3-4 minutes walking. \r\n\r\nYou could also camp on top of the house/store which has a flat roof and the view is amazing. We didn't do there as it was raining. \r\n\r\nThe brother of one of the guys who runs the place is renting equipment. We need backpack, but didn't rent as he asked for 75 quetzales per day. Across the street a place with banner \"Guia Local Don Valeriano\" also rents equipment. We rent backpack 70 litres in terrific condition for 50 quetzales for 2-3 days.

Wonderful mountain air. We were given a key to use the bathrooms in one of the hostel rooms - though this may not happen for you if all the hostel rooms are full once it opens properly.\r\n\r\nThere are some sheep and some ducks and some rabbits and the staff are super friendly. They even proactively helped us level our vehicle.\r\n\r\nGood WiFi. Electricity (if you have a very long cord). No Blackwater dumping. Good cell signal.\r\n\r\nUp to full size Sprinter van would fit no problem. Big rigs may fit if you're a solid driver and are ok with backing out all the way - it's a bit narrow. Worth checking. ",

These are two caves, B'omb'il Pek and Jul Iq' which you have to hike to for about 40 minutes. We liked it better than the Candelaria caves.\r\n\r\nB'omb'il Pek is a cave you can access by an 85m rappel (or very steep, unprotected stairs). Once in the cave you can crawl your way into a part of the cave with small 1500 yo. carbon drawings (which are a little bit damaged by a cave exploration expedition..). \r\n\r\nThe other cave Jul Iq' has some amazing structures and the light that enters the cave is just beautiful.\r\n\r\nGuides use professional equipment and are trained by ex-military. The income from tourism benefits their community, they explained that over the years it supported the building of a school and common meeting area. They are open to tourists again after 2.5 years of covid closure. \r\n\r\nIt's 75q pp to visit the cave and an extra 75q pp if you want to do the rappel. It's well worth it considering there'll be two guides and the tour is about 4 hours. Bring water, a snack and repellent. They need to know a day in advance, you can WhatsApp them (in Spanish) on +502-4998-7410.",

The adventure starts the moment you hit the dirt road in San Geronimo and drive 20kms through the mountains of Parque Nacional Montaña de Comayagua to reach the community of Rio Negro (4x4 and high clearance highly recommended). The Velazquez Family owns an organic coffee farm (the brother of Avelio sells it in Minnesota!) and have opened up their beautiful land to folks to camp on. 75L per car per night. No bathrooms for campers (yet!) but they can open up one of their cabanas for you to use, if needed. No wifi but they do have electricity (not at sites). As of now, there are two areas to camp - near the river or at \"the vista,\" which is flat and has an incredible view of the valley. Bertilia, the wife of Avelio, is also a great cook (vegetarian chorizo!) and offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner for an extra cost. And when you're wanting something active, you can take a hike through dense forest up to two waterfalls: Los Ensueños (50 min) and La Gavilán (1.5 hours and ~70m tall!!). No need for a guide - the trail is well-marked. We spent here 4 wonderful nights here and when we weren't outside enjoying the forest we were drinking coffee w our new friends in their kitchen :) ",

Had a very quiet night, felt safe.\nComing from Tegucigalpa and heading for Valle de Angeles, turn left about 500m after the Santa Lucia turnoff.\nRoom enough for an aircraft carrier or two.",

Next door is Centro Turistico Sambo Creek, run by TouristOptions agency in La Ceiba.\nThis is where boats leave for trips to Cayos Cochinos. Call ahead to TouristOptions to find out about sailings/schedules, minimum five people. Paid about 950 for a half day snorkeling trip which was great. Left the van here during the day and slept here two nights in the van. Busy with (friendly, respectful) locals, especially around 7 in the morning and after sunset, but absolutely quiet at night.\nI was reassured (and, at some point convinced) that the car was safe here, and that nothing had ever happened to any car here before.\nLocal watchman kept an eye on the car, asked for a little tip, so he got 80 for two days and nights.\nParking is free, probably even when not booking a trip to the keys. Neighbours offered to use their water tap and toilet hut. And then you still got the Centro Turistico bathrooms which the watchman will open for you on demand.\nBeach is nothing special. Saltwater spray to the car is not too bad.\nOne big rig should fit, but locals will be curious. Access road thru town is bumpy.\n",

Enrique, the caretaker, lives there and will open it up for you. Enrique and the owner, David, are lovely people and checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything. There are electric outlets at the palapas, but we didn’t use them, so not sure if they would want extra money or not. There is also a water spigot at each palapa.

Some apartments can accommodate up to 6. Book online at booking.com. Or call and make a reservation directly and the owner Milady will discount your price by 15%, same as the commission to booking.com.  \n\nSince it's a little out of town, its best to rent a bicycle or motor scooter for transport.

We parked on the grass lawn at the back, which was nice and quiet. They didn't charge us for camping, but we ate and drank at the resturaunt and used the pool which is 100 lp /adult or 60 lp/kid. The owner and workers were extremely friendly and happy to help and thought more overlanders would be great. It's a unique dream for the area the owner has and is continuing work on. Give them some business and continue this spot for overlanders. Should be easy to spot it has red,yellow, green gate and huge yellow tire advertising for the canopy. ",

Man with blue shirt will check aduana form and your vehicle (not much interest in finding anything).  Go into immigration to officer on far side of square.  Show passports and pay 45cordobas each to exit.  Continue down passage to aduana- hand over all vehicle docs and TIP - which they keep.  Drive towards Honduras- stop to give officer stamped aduana form and show receipt for exit tax.  In Honduras stop at migracion (actually has a sign on the building!).  Pay usd3 or 70limpura each. Find aduana - they will direct you to an office at the back where the SUPER unfriendly clerk will shuffle paperwork for the vehicle and take EXACTLY us$35 (for transit) as \"she has no change\" .  You go over the road through a maze of trucks to find nice gentleman to make copies, go back to clerk who issues TIP.  No insurance required for Honduras.  On drive out show officer TIP and you are free to go.  Just a caution:  the road into Honduras here is really bad - not recommended for night driving.  We were stopped once on this road the next day.  They searched the vehicle but did not ask for the fire extinguisher and reflective things (suspect this fad has faded).",

    "description": "Great hostel and dive center ! To begin with logistics: the place is well located by the sea and has a small private beach with volleyball court and sunbeds and it is easy to drop in the sea to cool off and swim. There are plenty of hammocs and the bar has a pool table. Prices are really cheap : 299$ for the PADi and you get free accomodation for 4 nights as well as 2 fun dives if you take a class  , otherwise the price for accomodation is 6$ for a shared dorm. There are several private dorms that accomodate 2 people so if you get lucky only, you can have one of this room for the same price (and the room has its own bathroom). \r\nWith regards to diving course; I was really impressed by so much professionalism. Nico and Steve were so great instructors. Nico is really passionated about diving and the ocean and wants to communicate that joy with you. He won't let you down if you panic. In a word , safety was always present and learning diving became a great experience I won't forget. \r\nWith regards to the hostel it is truly a younger population here (mainly from England ?) But everybody was friendly and the music was not overwhelming at all.  Found buddies all over the place. Recommend +++",

We ordered fish and shrimp. It was very good served with plantains, and very inexpensive. The owner arrived and spoke English.  Also very friendly. She said we could put our tent up right under her shelters and offered us hammocks to sleep in. The strong breeze kept us cool and kept any bugs that might have been there away. She said the place was safe, with only a handful of locals in the area, but the van was not parked far from where we set up. It was raw natural beauty.  There were local dogs around so I’m sure pets would have been welcome even though we aren’t traveling with any. Our kids played with the local kids there.  They didn’t charge us to camp there, to use their toilet, (which you had to carry a bucket of water to flush), or to use their hammocks.  I wouldn’t recommend big rigs as the road is rough and the sand soft. We were in a 15 passenger van with no problem. ",

This dish (Corte de Filete), served with papas and veggies cost L420 ($18) and was worth every penny. The staff were super friendly, attentive and welcoming. It was a pleasure for them to host us, they even prepared their specialty hamburger on the house for us. It was huge! 1lb of beef! La Torona de las Tablas would normally cost L285 ($12). And out of the blue, I received a free cocktail (costing L120 -$4) \r\nIf you want to make a night of it, you’d probably be able to camp here too. We asked the manager and she said yes.

There seemed to be a nice camping right at the end of the road before the river.\r\n- get ready for some very pushy locals trying to sell you the canyoning tour. Prices start at $20 pp, we got it down to 12$ pp, but didn't go at the end because we didn't feel like getting wet (it wasn't really warm and we've already been to ATM in Belize, but it should be nice)\r\n- If you just want to see the canyon, you don't need a guide - pay 2$ pp at the entrance booth and either leave your car there or drive down to the river (parking ca 20 Cordobas) and walk up stream, crossing the river twice (jumping across on rocks, you don't have to get wet). At one point the path ends and you can take a small boat for 25 Cordobas pp. 500 meters further into the canyon. There should be also another path that would lead you up to the canyon rim and a mirador (it is marked on OpenStreet Maps).",

They may have moved on when you decide to visit and it is up in the air whether this place will be running. \nTo get here you have to cross the gate into the Hacienda Iguana compound.  tell the security guard you are are going to Dale Daggers place.  tell them you have a reservation. drive for a while until you see a road going left with some yellow rocks to mark it.  if you get to the 2nd iguana gate you have gone too far.  drive on the road until you get to the surf shack on the right.  5$ pp. \nphone number: 8417 3795",

    "description": "The entry of the canyon is on the left side coming from El Espino border. There is a brown sign that indicates it.  There is going to be a man that stops you for offering you park and tours (he is kind of aggressive with it, pushing the tour on us and that we didn't have other options. That's not true, just say no thanks and keep going down the road until you reach the information wood house on the right). There you have to park and go in the wood house and they will inform you what's the canyon all about and tell you you have 2 options of tours with them, the short one that is 12usd p/p (2 hours) and the 17usd p/p (3hr30min: 4usd for the park entry fee, some for the boat and the rest goes to a cooperative of the guides families). We chose to do it by ourselves even they tried to tell us we couldn't. The long tour is the most amazing one and the better experience of the canyon (a hike, swim through the tall walls of the canyon, then boat and hike back). Again they will make you feel that you have to take the tour but you can do it by yourself (be sure you know how to swim well though). If you pay the tour we recommend a guide that we happen to meet on our solo walk, Teo Flores Figueroa. He was so kind and sweet to us, great heart, giving us free information even when we didn't payed for the tour. Contact him directly if you want (84266408). \nWe only pay the 4usd of park fee and drove the car down the road to the next parking lot (30cordobas to the woman there). Then we walk down to the river and randomly met Teo that recommend us to do it the other way (the long tour). We did and was awesome!! We gave him a money gift just because he was so awesome to us, he never asked for anything and was genuinely surprised when we wanted to give him some money. Anyway, we recommend him specially and the swimming down the canyon is amazing (just beware that is a long swim and you go through a hike before it and on the river there are rocks parts you need to walk through). Overall, epic!",

Just ask for him in town or call 89213127\r\nThe road there is gravel but it is really good and hard packed to even in rainy season you can get there in a car or motorcycle.\r\nDid not get a picture from the front of the house but it is on the top af the little hill on your right side just before you get to Sabalos.",

    "description": "If you have a small vehicle ( we drive a landrover with rooftop tents, you can drive up some thing a little bigger than that), 4x4 and high clearance you can drive very close to the crater of volcan Telica. The dirt road starts at the beginning of the main road  between telica and chinandega coming from telica.\r\nIts a veru slow drive of about 1,5 hours. You arrive at a small parking where there might be a guardian charging the  entrance fee of 3 US pr person. From here you can walk about 1.5 km to the crater. Great views along the whole trail and also from the parking.Asked guardian. Said you can spend the night. Safe.\r\nWe continued another 10 min along the dirt road which deteriorates and becomes somewhat diffecult. Ends up at a small community where there is a kind of cabana where people visiting the volcano can sleep in hammocks or on mattresses. You can camp there as well. No view but the hike to the volcano and mirador is shorter and easier, about 20-30 min. We spent the night there. Both overnight spots are free. The first parking more quiet. No roosters, dogs etc. \r\nBoth places have very simple toilets.\r\nVolcano and views from volcano towards Volcan Momotombo and San Cristobal fantastic. Worth the long and slow drive.\r\n",

Guests often told us it was the highlight of their trip. \n\nLeón is only place in the world you can board (sledge) down a volcano! Combining this with a 2 day camping trip (El Hoyo) is very popular, as is camping just below the rim of the smoking and lava filled Volcan Telica. There are also more and less strenuous tours available.\n\nThis is the only charity tour operator and they offer the best trips in the city. All equipment is provided - you just need to bring enthusiasm.\n\nLeón is a fantastic vibrant city full of nightlife and cheap eats thanks to all the students. The Maribios volcano range is just awesome - where else can you stand  on the edge of a 120m vertical drop into a highly active crater and see lava with not even a warning sign in sight?!\n\nUnfortunately there isn't a good official overlander spot but there are many roads that are wide enough to park on (be warned this is not a quiet city so expect fireworks, and the twice daily air raid siren!), or stay in a cheap hostel ($20-25 for a private room) and pay a buck to leave the van in the parqueo.\n\nNicaragua is the land of lakes and volcanoes so don't miss a chance to explore and let your dollars improve the lives of kids who struggle to get a daily meal.",

The people from the Rescue Station do their best to find the turtles before other locals do. Who take the eggs and sell them as a food delicacy as a mean of income, particularly in the largely impoverished coastal regions.\nRobert, who runs the organization uses his retirement funds to pay his stuff and tries to buy as many eggs he can afford from the locals (for example 100 eggs about 560 NIO).\nWe were also there when a local came by selling the eggs, and we could assist to bury them in a safe and secured nest, where they hatch about 40-50 days later.\n\nThe Sea Turtle Rescue Station doesn't ask for money but donations are highly welcomed. They also sell small plastic turtles. Made by women from the village who use recycled material. One turtle is 5 USD, 1 for the woman and 4 for the organisation.\n\nIt was a breathtaking and amazing experience to see so many different aspects of a turtle rescue and to have the possibility to be involved as much as you want to.\n\nYou can find this place if you walk 150 metres north on the beach from Rancho Tranquillo and look for the small sign \"Sea Turtle Rescue Nicaragua\". You can just walk in and say hello to Robert, the American who runs this place, and ask about the turtles. \n\nReleased turtles 2016: about 6000",

We asked if we could camp the night and they agreed. In the knowledge that we would eat and have a drink they did not charge us other than C$40pp for using the pools.  Children’s play area and pool and rabbits around (so not sure they would allow pets)   The location is set back from the road, so quiet, secure (guard), everyone very friendly and the pools a refreshing break.  Very clean. Excellent food. Beer cheap.  The owner gave us a key to one of the rooms so we could use the bathroom/shower but there are public toilets anyway.  We didn’t connect water or electricity. There are taps around. Don’t know if they would allow this as we didn’t ask. \n\nAlso a great place to stop and have a refreshing swim and bite to eat it you want to continue on your journey but just need a break.  \n\nA great place.

She has grabbed my arm to drag me into the kitchen to point at a dirty dish that wasn’t ours and generally tells you off a few times a day for random things that are either irrelevant or nothing to do with you. She stole my friends hammock over a dispute about a broken blender that was so old it just fell apart. We camped for $3 per person which is great but there are other places around for the same price. The owner is incredibly difficult to deal with and I would not recommend! ",

    "description": "Scott, a really awesome human, when he came to live here, while he was rescuing all the dogs as he could, he realized that the locals were picking up all the turtle eggs for money, so the way he found to prevent this culture trade and considerable decline of the turtles was to buy the eggs back from the community. If money is the problem then he decided to buy them and also help the community. \n\nIf you want to have an incredible experience volunteering at sanctuary turtle rescue program helping turtles come into the world with your own hands - because it is part of the rescuing protocol, otherwise they would not be saved, and release them in the sand to make their walk to life through the sand, and then contemplate this unique scenario, you shouldn’t miss this place!! If in the season they release every single day between 200-500 baby turtles. Just keep in mind that the opening of the eggs happens around 1:00pm and the turtles sand release around 5:00pm. Check also with Rachel or Matt from Salt Escapes Lodge if it is the right season. https://www.saltescapesnicaragua.com/ \n\nScott allowed me to park on his property for free right on the beach. Not easy to drive here, not at all! you must really enjoy driving on dirt roads, but it’s worth it! \n\nTo get here from Managua: Drive north towards Leon turn left onto Camino Salinas Grandes about 25 km from Leon or about 7 -10 mins after the highways meet there is an antenna with a movie star logo on the north west corner. Take the road until there is a fork in the road and then stay right. Continue until just after the cemetery on your left , you will see a road called “Los lirios”. Go left onto that and follow till the clearing. Follow the playa Tesoro signs until you reach the blue wall, then go left. The sanctuary is at the house where the wall ends - Tundra Propriety. (DO NOT FOLLOW GOOGLE MAPS - it will take you to a road that actually it is not correct.\n\nIf you do not want to drive through that really tough “Los Lirios” dirt road, another option is to park at Casa de Rigo Sampson and next day you can walk along the sand to the sanctuary, shouldn’t be that far.\n\nEnjoy it!",

    "description": "Here's the deal for flying out of this airport and leaving your vehicle long term.  The airport charges 150 cordobas per night to park.  Parking is directly in front of the airport.  Completely hassle free although Tuesdays and Thursdays the parking lot closes at 1030pm (if you fly in after that suspect you can just sleep in the camper).  All other days it closes at 2am.  Opens at 5am.  We are not sure if they would hassle you to actually sleep in your camper in the lot so we slept at an Puma gas station just down the road with a truck stop area at the back (bring earplugs).  Super convenient, 24 hr guard for 50 cordobas.  The alternative is the Best Western directly across from the airport (you can just walk across the road to and from).  They wanted you to book a room at approx us$95 and then will charge us$7 per night to park.  The airport itself is really nice and very small.  TONS of souvenirs to buy if you need to (beautifully set out in a market type atmosphere).  There is a departure tax of us$35 but ours was included in our ticket).  On our return (ticket one way into Nicaragua) they did not need to see a flight or bus ticket out of Nicaragua.",

Horse carriages, and taxis readily available if needed right out the front door. They had a private, locked parking area on what looked like a private home property a block away. We drive a 15 passenger van, with a car topper, and that fit, but I’m not sure how larger rigs might fit. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. A very refreshing reprieve after days of hot camping.

Good food at reasonable prices in the restaurant (crisp and yummy veggies here!).\r\nBoth hosts are very knowledgeable about Nica and Costa Rica, and the place is a good spot to see wildlife, wich they will help to spot as well. Wonderful place to stargaze, very little light pollution!\r\nNo on site beach access, but the beach is close by. \r\nVery good place to be early at the border crossing into Costa Rica from Nicaragua. \r\nWiFi in the Restaurant area only.",

There is a beautiful garden and a place to do yoga near a small river.\r\n\r\nThey rent rooms and cabañas 200/300 C pp per night. The prices are negotiable. There are shared rooms for rent costing 35 usd per person with breakfast, lunch and dinner. It also includes a path to the rainbow waterfall with a guide. Bathroom included, cold shower.\r\n\r\nSaturday and Tuesday there are free capoeira lessons at 4:30 pm\r\n\r\nThe place is eco-style, everything goes good with nature.\r\n\r\nThey let us park for free at a place near the property but it really was quite steep. With a couple of stones and a shovel we leveled the camper a bit because the place seemed beautiful.\r\n\r\nWith the waste from the bathroom they generate gas for the kitchen. They have an orchard with basil, mint, lettuce, squash, custard apple.\r\n\r\nThey sell the pound of coffee at 100C.\r\n\r\nArturo the manager is the son of Don Chico. For 200 C per person, it guides you to the waterfall and the cloud forest.\r\n\r\nFrom May to February is the rainy season, it is difficult to find a time that does not rain. We were in the best time, we had sunny days and others of rain. Because of this nature is amazing we saw many exotic and beautiful birds. It is part of the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve, the second largest in America after the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe truth that the place surprised us, it is worth coming here and stay a couple of days enjoying the energy of this natural paradise.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Massif, if you are lucky, you can see the quetzal.\r\n\r\nWe saw oropendulas!\r\n\r\nDo not stop coming to this place if it's just the rainforest, the cloud forest and the contact with nature!\r\n\r\nWe came to eat in the dining room and to chat with Isaac, the coordinator and guide of the establishment. We do not stay here.\r\n\r\nThey sell honey.\r\n-----\r\nNos dejaron estacionar gratis en un lugar cerca de la propiedad pero realmente estaba bastante empinado. Con un par de piedras y con una pala nivelamos un poco el camper porque el lugar nos pareció hermoso.\r\n\r\nCon los residuos del baño generan gas para la cocina. Tienen una huerta con albahaca, menta, lechuga, zapallo, anona. \r\n\r\nVenden la libra de cafe a 100C.\r\n\r\nArturo el encargado es el hijo de Don Chico. Por 200 C por persona te hace de guía a la cascada y el bosque nuboso.\r\n\r\nHay cuartos compartidos para rentar cuestan 35 usd por persona con desayuno, almuerzo y cena. Incluye también sendero a la cascada arco iris con guía. Baño incluido, ducha fría.\r\n\r\nDe mayo a febrero es la temporada de lluvia, es difícil encontrar un momento que no llueva. Nosotros estuvimos en la mejor época, tuvimos días de sol y otros de lluvia. Debido a esto la naturaleza es sorprendente vimos muchos pájaros exóticos y hermosos. Es parte de la Reserva Biosfera Bosawás, la segunda más grande de America después del Amazonas.\r\n\r\nLa verdad que el lugar nos sorprendió, vale la pena venir aquí y quedarse un par de días disfrutando de la energía de este paraíso natural.\r\n\r\nEn la cima del Macizo, si se tiene suerte, se puede ver al quetzal. \r\n\r\nNosotros vimos oropendulas!\r\n\r\nNo dejen de venir a este lugar si les justa la selva tropical, el bosque nuboso y el contacto con la naturaleza!\r\n\r\nNosotros vinimos a comer al comedor y a charlar con Isaac, el coordinador y guía del establecimiento.

    "description": "This is the office of a coop that organizes tours in the reserva Miraflor. We went for a tour with Alexander who showed us the area and we really liked it.\r\nThe tour lasts the whole day, you have to take the bus early in the morning and you get back mid afternoon. You can customize the tour: choose to have a typical breakfast and or a lunch or just one of them. A family will prepare it for you at their house. Most of them could host you for a night of you need it.\r\nWe had an overview of the high zone of the reserve by walking through it, a mixt of forest and dry field land. We also went to an orchidea garden before lowering down to the medium zone and enjoy a small fall with cold water : super refreshing. Finally we have been to a viewpoint and got down a small trail to reach the bus stop. Very unique experience and everyone were happy to talk to us. We paid per person 14US for the breakfast, the guide and the garden, 10C for the Cascade, 65C for the round-trip in bus. \r\nYou can also buy coffee directly at the coop, for 140C or 80C a pound.\r\nPeople super friendly and the front desk women can talk English",

We should have known better, especially as Raby had asked what time we'd be back and looked concerned (but when directly asked if it was safe to walk, he'd said yes) and a local guide in Awas tried to get us to pay him to walk us, but we refused. \r\n\r\nWe were initially followed and approached by a teenager simply demanding 'give me your money'. My boyfriend insisted we had none while I kept walking. He left. \r\n\r\nA few minutes later the same guy came back with his friend and cornered us in on the boardwalk section. They tried to grab my bag, I resisted as it seemed they were not armed, all 4 of us scuffled and I managed to keep hold of the bag by lying on it. At this point another group of people approached and the guys left, and we ran into town. \r\n\r\nWe went for dinner anyway assuming we'd find a taxi back after. Struggled to find a taxi but fortunately some friends of the Queen Lobster owner offered us a ride. \r\n\r\nTogether with a robbery in Awas too (see entry on there) and some general verbal abuse and bad feelings, we left Pearl Lagoon much sooner than we'd planned. This is the first time in 3 months in Central America we've had any problems. Disappointing as the town is beautiful and has huge potential for tourists, and Raby and his family are amazing. ",

We paid $20US per person or 660cord pp. which included 2 nights of camping, and the tour of the entire canyon with life jackets, boat ride, waterproof bag for your phone or sandwiches if needed (Jancy carries this so be aware of weight).\r\n\r\nWe read on other ioverlander spots that some people do this without a tour guide. After doing it however, all four of us agreed that having a guide is really your best bet. There are a few poisonous plants to look out for and one mandatory 2m jump into the water. Only if you are very well educated and experienced in these things should you go it alone.\r\n\r\nJancy can negotiate the camping so come here first. You can then negotiate with the property owners at the campsite for additional days if desired. We were able to stay extra days by simply purchasing breakfast which was very affordable $1.50US pp.\r\n\r\nJancy also accompanied us at no cost to Somoto and gave us some history of the town. She also took us on a tour of a local watermelon farm (she did not ask any money but we tipped her).\r\n\r\nYou can find her here or contact her on WhatsApp at +50589193043",

    "description": "Most memorable experience in our 7 months of overland travel! We found the location on google maps and were unsure what to expect. The phone number connected us to the family and we were told that it is not recommended we make the drive without a 4x4 vehicle. We gave it a try with our 2wd Toyota van with regular clearance. The last km was muddy with deep puddles but we made it and are so happy that we did. The Mairena family are amazing and have a wonderful reserva where they grow coffee, bananas, beans, and produce honey. They respect the land and have incredible knowledge of the flora and fauna, which they share in abundance. We saw sloths, Congo monkeys, beautiful birds, and some sweet local dogs. There is room for 2 rigs below and a couple tough 4x4s could climb the road up and park on the flats higher up. There is a flush toilet and shower and even rooms with a bed. A couple bars of Claro 3G when up the hill.\r\n\r\nWe were welcomed into their home and invited to share in daily gatherings. It is hard to put into words the love and respect we feel for them and how much the experience impacted us. The price is $5usd/night to camp and $8usd/night for a bed. They never brought up money and weren’t sure how much to suggest as we were the first Overlanders. We sat down and discussed details for this post as all we want to do is help them moving forward. In the end, we gave them all the money we had as a symbolic gesture but the experience was priceless. Come stocked with food, the drive and beauty will make you want to stay several days. Potable water available fresh off the mountain.\r\n\r\nGoogle maps may give you the wrong turn from San Ramón. Always take the Calle de la Hermandad. You pass through a very manicured coffee plantation. With about 1.5km left you can either go left on Calle de la Hermandad or right (both meet back in the middle). We took the right road as the left one seemed muddier. The last 1km is all dirt and very difficult. Stop when you see the faded reserva sign where you can either go up with the proper vehicle or camp below next to the bamboo (see photo). The family live close by and you will find each other.",

Which is pretty stupid in out book, so we decided to camp elsewhere and visit the park in the morning, even though the camping itself was nice. In retrospect we shouldn't have paid for the park at all - there is nothing to see, except one smallish waterfall. No maps, no hiking trails.\r\n- There was at least one more possible spot between here and the park entrance - starting at the entrance head west and after about 1 km on your right there is a steep dirt road leading down to the lake. The downside is that you are easily visible from the ranger's office/park entrance there, and the ranger specifically told us that this is a park area and we need to pay the entrance to be there. But you can try before talking to anybody, worst case you can move here afterwards.\r\n",

Don't come here unless you have a new vehicle. Bad service, lacking basic courtesy, they just don't care. Also, they didn’t have a certain tool (just a freakin spanner), so at some point they just said it can’t be done. Had to insist they buy their tool, which they did. Had to sleep infront of workshop (no security) because brakes were blocked and everyone left. In the end I have no idea whether they really did change one bearing as you are neither allowed in the workshop nor to talk to your mechanic. Car and parts were returned dirty and with scratches. The worst possible service experience. Labour costs 66 USD per hour. Avoid this place if you can.",

    "description": "Owned by Italian lady Marina, this is a hotel with just a few rooms on a back street of Boca Chica (well, this place only has back streets). Mind the low branches,we are 3.1 meters high and pruned some trees. Camping next to building underneath trees, use of shower and toilet in a room. US $ 20 per night, 2 persons and a van. US $ 2,50 per day per computer (!) for the use of internet (reasonably fast); not really a sympathetic gesture. There is an outdoor space underneath a roof for relaxing, including hammocks (though 1 is taken by the owner). Howler monkeys, geese, chickens and roosters. Marina brought some potable water in gallon bottles, tea one day and some handmade icecream the next. We took the lancha for US $ 1 per person to Boca Brava island, where we hiked on the muddy roads in search of Hotel Boca Brava (supposedly with hiking trails, restaurant, kayak rental), which we did not find. Better ask the lancha captain to take you there. Instead we hiked to the Seagull Cove Lodge to have lunch in the restaurant with a killer view (no camping allowed, we asked).To be honest; Boca Chica is not really an action-packed destination. But it's fine just to chill. We spend 2 nights. Boy, it can really rain cats and dogs here at night.",

    "description": "I would just really quickly like to make everyone feel better who is worrying about the shipping thing. We did RoRo with WWL yesterday without an agent. I was very worried about that day because the process and involved difficulty is put into a worse light than needed (in my opinion at least), so I would like to make a positive statement about it for once: IT IS NOT THAT BAD! Just like a big border day. You go to 3-4 different offices, then get your car inspected and off you go. Of course it is a little stressful, but if you have been ok with the borders, you will be ok here. Even more than ok, because people were much more helpful (locals and officials) than at many borders. Also to note: Fewer people than at borders and no pushy helpers. Just follow the steps 1-4 on iOverlander and you will be fine. We started at 8 o´clock at the office of the Shipping company (nicest office, but unfriendliest people of the day) and were done with it all by 1:30 pm.\r\n\r\nAnd if you need a wall to be put in behind your drivers compartment for roro: Procars in Panama City do it (on ioverlander) at around 50$.\r\n\r\nAgent: Not needed in my opinion with all the info available online etc.\r\n\r\nPolice Inspection (Things I did not know): You can turn up at that parkinglot very early to draw a number if you want. Some people got Number 9 at 6 am (??!), but we got number 14 at 7:30 am and did not have to wait long to have the car inspected, so I think it is not worth it getting there THAT early. One thing which did take much longer than expected (and was a problem for others because they had an appointment with their agent or something) was picking up the Papers at 2. We waited for over an hour, so have that time accounted for.\r\n\r\nRoad from Panama City to Colon (also very diff. to find info): Panapass is only for the coredor norte, not for the road to Colon. If you get out of the city without the Coredor norte (no problem really), then you will get to a \"cuota\" road to colon at some point. Here you pay 2,50$ cash and off you ride. We started driving at 6:30 on a weekday from the Yacht Club and got to the Terminal in Colon at 8:15.\r\nMaybe this helps someone to relax about it all. Have a great day!",

They have rooms for 30 usd. He would not let us camp in front of the house that was the only place that was flat.They said they have WIFI but we never managed to connect. Actually, he had to buy some data as they dont have proper landline but a router with limited data.Not recommended \u0026 definitely not overlander friendly.

Upon arrival in Guayaquil, we found out that he never paid the shipping costs (ocean freight), and even though he promised multiple times to pay it, he never did, and we ended up paying it ourselves (so double) in Guayaquil. Note that there was also a Peruvian guy who shipped his camper from Florida on the same vessel, and he had to pay 3000 USD (!) Ocean freight again because of Gaston's refusal to pay the shipping company. We also found out that, even though there are some positive experiences, Gaston is doing this to people since long time.

Feels pretty comfortable provided you have some kind of sleeping pad . Hidden from the road ",

Buy beers, share food, support the place and you can negotiate the price maybe. Really great guy David owns the place. Really likes travelers. Possible to arrange a boat trip to the cave on the lake. lake is not great for swimming, but really beautiful. depending on the time of the year rivers nearby better. Monkeys nearby:) water, toilet, energy. possible to use the septic input to empty your tank but need to talk with owner. \r\nThere is a supermarket close by. \r\nUse whatsapp +507-66252861 message a day before is best as sometimes he is away for full days. \r\n\r\nUpdate Feb/2018: Saw a monkey tied to a tree here.

They picked us up at the train station in Colón, prepared all the documents, took us to the Customs Office for signing the necessary papers, drove us to a food court for lunch where we waited while the container was fumigated and transported to a container yard. By 4 p.m., all we had to do is drive our cars out of the container – easy and no sweat. For this \"all inclusive\" service we paid USD 600 for the two cars including 1 month car insurance. If you are shipping the car in the opposite direction, from Panama to Colombia, Ever Logistics works closely together with Enlace Caribe in Cartagena who offer the same kind of friendly and efficient service.

If you do not have a good transport, contact Lorenzo Gordon. He is a excellent taxi driver and speaks fluently english. lorenzogordon1905@gmail.com/ Tel. +507 6716-1851. He drives you wherever you want, cost per hour is US$ 15.-- within Panama City, Chilibre-Panama about US$20.--. You can do all 3 places in about half a day.\r\n\r\n       From the bond at Transbal in Chilibre you get all papers. Then you go to Transbal in Panama City (Edificio Siglo XXI, office at ground level, coordinates 8.9958 -79.534081); they prepare the papers for the aduana/custom.\r\n     Then Aduana Central in Panama City (coordinates 8.973909 -79.547051), there you ask for the counter \"control vehicular\". They put a stamp in your passport that you are allowed to leave the country without the vehicle.\r\n\r\nWhen you come back, you do the same thing reverse, but first you will have to buy a new insurance (US$ 25.-- for a MAN truck for 30 days; for example at \"Seguros Fedpa SA\" in Panama City, coordinates 8.978285 -79.528618). The custom/aduana gives you the new TIP only with a valid insurance! After the insurance you go to the custom/\"aduana central, control vehicular\" (new TIP, no costs; and they put a stamp in your passport that you are not allowed to leave the country without the vehicle). Then go to Transbal in Panama City. There you pay the bond and they give you the paper in order to get your vehicle at the bond at Transbal in Chilibre. These 3 places in Panama City you can do within half a day. Lorenzo drives you there and waits for you. Transbal in Chilibre closes at 17.00 o'clock.

The road is basically only doable in standard SUVs...\nIf you make it up there, there is a relatively even parking lot about 400m behind the rangers station.

    "description": "START HERE FOR PET RESERVATIONS- At this counter sits the woman with all the power.  She will either admit or decline your pet on the flight of your choice.  After you have done the veterinarian health certificate and the MIDA form you need to come here. Begin by looking at flights that work for you. (mornings are best so you have time for paperwork at other end, read about it in ioverlander at Cartagena airport before you go)\r\nOnce you have flight in mind, go to this counter with the kennel, the dog, copies of all paper work and patience. She will approve the kennel and the pet.  Note that if the pet is aggressive, scary, old, or certain breeds she can deny it to fly! You must have food and water taped to the kennel and two dishes to dispense them in.  (Kennels available at Discovery Center also marked on iOverlander)\r\nAsk her to give you any forms that are needed.  Complete them and have her review and submit them  Wait for her to give you a bill of lading and confirmation number that corresponds with the flight you selected.  Pay the fees and confirm that things are all set.  Ask her where and when you need to check in with the pet.  Ask her to email you all confirmations and documentations. \r\nOur story- We arranged all the reservations by email with CopaCargo.  We went directly to the loading dock confirm the kennel. We submitted photos of all paperwork and were send confirmations.  We believed we were all set for the flight and then the night before they sent MORE papers to complete in a locked PDF format.  We found a way to complete them and emailed the papers back the night before the flight.  The next morning we checked in with the dog 3.5 hours before the flight. (as per the paperwork we had completed) This power-woman said that we were too late, then said that nothing was confirmed and we had no reservation, then looked for errors on the papers, problems with the kennel, etc.  She ultimately reviewed all the saved emails I had screen shots of and all the photos of being at the loading dock and relented.   Essentially she was trying to do everything possible to deny flying the dog on the flight we had reserved.  I have never seen a company work so hard to NOT accept business.  Even once we were finished and ready to walk away I was told I would get an email describing the pick up process and confirming the booking while we were in flight.  It has been a week and no such email has yet been received.  Please feel free to contact me for further info. \r\nNOTE: I cannot condone illegal or immoral behavior, but there are veterinarians that will write a certificate stating that your dog needs to accompany you on the airplane.  (ESA) If you and your pet are up for it, that may be simpler than this crazy process.  You still need health documents, but you can avoid CopaCargo altogether.",

It can definitely fit bit rigs since once a big bus with locals parked there. When we were there (off season) the owner was just there on weekends but he let us stay also during the week and we closed the gate when we went away. No facilities but the restaurant on the other side of the road charges 1$ per shower.\r\n\r\nFor surfers: \r\nthe parking is next to the beach break. if you wanna surf the main point of Santa Catalina, you might wanna go to a restaurant or hostel up in the hill or closer to the town, it's a bit of a walk from the parking.

I did it with my loaded bicycle, crossing the bridge and riding most of the road but the last meters were it gets steeper.\r\nHad an amazing two weeks sharing with Maria y Chon, learning a lot about Panamanians life, farming, organic practices and helping them when they needed a translator.

We got an official doctor prescription saying my wife has anxiety and needs to have an Emotional Support Animal. With Copa (and Wingo), an ESA can fly with you, in the cabin, for free. When you book your tickets online, you have to call them to let them know you have an ESA (at least 48h before the flight). At the airport, we were never asked for any document. We walked in with our dog on the leash, checked in, passed security, walked across the airport, waited two hours at the gate, boarded the plane and took off with him on our lap, without a single question asked!! We had the ESA prescription, but never needed it.\r\n\r\nWhen we landed in Colombia, after being stamped, an officer came to see us and told us we needed to fill an import form and pay. We needed his health certificate, a photocopy of his vaccination (proof of anti-rabies) and the MIDA export form from Panama (don’t forget to do it before leaving Panama!). In all, it took about 20 minutes and cost ~48 000 COP. \r\n\r\nWelcome to South America with your dog the easy way!",

Indeed, it has long been considered one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Panama City, ever since the US invaded to take out strongman Manuel Noriega in Dec 1989.  It is today a vibrant but downtrodden neighborhood which everyone will tell you to avoid.  \r\n\r\nWe hooked up with Victor of @localinpty (Instagram), who does cultural walking tours of Casco, Santa Ana, and El Chorillo.  He also gives a lot back to the community, teaching English to both adults and children, setting up safe places for kids to play and learn, and is creating an amazing community outreach and educational program for adventurous travellers.  We were completely safe in Victor\"s hands and our two hour walkabout was one of the highlights of our time in Panama.  \r\n\r\nVictor charges $75 per person for a three hour walking tour, but realize that he gives back so much to the community we felt like it was a worthy cause.\r\n\r\nIf you want an experience well out of the mainstream, we highly recommend Victor.  He is the only one doing tours to this area and has a good rapport with the police and the locals.  WhatsApp Victor at +507 6118 7621.",

The access road was very muddy and slippery since it had rained the night before. You definitely need a high clearance vehicle and even 4x4 if it’s been raining at all. I wouldn’t try the road in the rainy season unless you have a serious Jeep. The owner of the hotel let us camp on his land down the road that he’s trying to sell. He also let us fill up our water tank.  Nice little surf spot in front and also some good waves on the other side of the island. We stayed for free. Enjoy!",

Listen and watch howler monkeys in their native habitat, a must for anybody traveling in the tropics. Fishing and diving are popular around here and the restaurant will cook any catch for a small fee. Full services are offered with restaurants, bar, and rustic accommodations and yes, your cell phone works fine here. Guests may choose to camp in the shaded camping area or in beach ranchitos, also a small  farm house rancho. Catamaran tours to nearby islands and fishing, diving, and surfing tours are available. The calm bay at gavilla beach is ideal for those who want a mellow, relaxing vibe,and enjoy the many wild species here. The road in to eco gavilla is a bit rough, once turning left onto the dirt road, just before reaching playa hermosa you will have a 7 mile dirt road, that is a bit rough in a few spots, but doable at slow pace,no 4+4 is necessary until rainy season. Some prefer to park at Playa Hermosa and take a water taxi, there is secured parking for 3$ per vehicle and the taxi across the bay casts 2$ per person, each way. Reservations are recommended midweek but weekends not necessary. Note that boats run from around 10:30-5:00, with exceptions due to tides, but captains will accommodate special requests. Camping is $5per person per night, ranch house rental$30 per night±50763602461, reservations and more information ",

We don't have 4x4, just go slow for the last little bit and be smart. \r\n\r\nWouldn’t recommend a big rig because the last stretch of road, but the spot itself is large enough. ",

Nothing around except for some housing being built on the end of the beach, so bring everything you need. \r\n\r\nTo get here you take the road to Playa Caracol. Then take the dirt road and go for about 2km  keep your eyes open to take an “exit”\r\nTo your right that will take you to the beach.

They have cabins for rent but we asked “Macho”, the person in charge of the place, if we could stay a couple of nights in our campervan. He had never done this before but he allowed us and charged 10 dollars per night. There is no bathroom but we could use the outside shower and the yoga covered terrace for cooking with our own staff. They have only a hammock and 2 chairs there. It is a rustic and very nice spot… it feels like if you where in the middle of the jungle. We could see lots of animals around including monkeys, toucans, and even a snake! We stayed here 3 nights and it was an incredible experience. The place is very calm and feels very safe. Just watch out your food from monkeys!",
